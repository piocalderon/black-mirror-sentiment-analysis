_

3
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:45,322
I'm gonna have to ask you
to switch that off for now.

4
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,565
Okay, thanks.

5
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:05,682
You know what it's kinda like?
It's kinda like a rollercoaster.

6
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,002
You know what I mean?
It's like a roller coaster.

7
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:13,525
Try it, try it with me.

8
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:44,565
How tall... How tall is the Eye?

9
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,405
How tall... How tall is Big Ben?

10
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:27,259
Since then, I've been working
as a technology correspondent

11
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:29,219
for about two years now. It's been great.

12
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:32,859
Cool, that's awesome. So you do, like,
TV reports and, like, you're like...

13
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:35,139
- No, just the website.
- Oh, just the website?

14
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,779
I mean, there's some video stuff,
but tech industry pieces mainly.

15
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:41,019
Cool, tech. Tech's awesome. Tech's...

16
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:43,219
So where have you been so far?

17
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:46,059
Travelling around the
map like Indiana Jones?

18
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:47,499
- Yeah.
- Where the adventure line

19
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:49,659
goes zigzagging all over the place.

20
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:52,939
Yeah, actually, I'm almost done. Uh...

21
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:56,739
But I started off, flew into
Sydney, went to Thailand.

22
00:04:56,742 --> 00:04:59,579
- Oh, jealous.
- India. Yeah.

23
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,259
Did Rome, went to Rome.

24
00:05:01,262 --> 00:05:04,139
- Did the whole Europe vacation.
- Even I haven't done that.

25
00:05:04,142 --> 00:05:05,379
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

26
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:08,779
It was awesome. I went
to Pamplona in Spain.

27
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:11,139
- Is that where they do the bull runs?
- Ran with the bulls.

28
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:13,059
- You ran with the bulls?
- I ran with the bulls.

29
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,859
- That's how I got this.
- Look at that!

30
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:16,259
You really are Indiana Jones.

31
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:18,379
Have you got your whip
in your bag and your hat?

32
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:20,859
I saved the world from the Nazis.
That was pretty cool.

33
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,739
I, you know, just... trying to do,
you know, shit I've never done before.

34
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:28,182
Is that what you're doing on this trip?
You're, like, finding yourself?

35
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,982
- Yeah, um... in a way.
- I mean, I...

36
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:37,379
Really to get away from the
family home is what I'm doing.

37
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:38,659
Oh.

38
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:42,619
Yeah, that was...
Whatever, that's boring.

39
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,099
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
Britain's pretty tame

40
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:47,379
as far as daredevil opportunities go.

41
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:50,379
Yeah? It's alright, it's the last
leg of the trip anyway so...

42
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:53,979
I'm... unfortunately home next week.

43
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:55,579
- Not much time...
- Next week?

44
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:58,342
- Yeah.
- That's not very long.

45
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,139
- No, it's not.
- Mnh-mnh.

46
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:06,622
So... I could use some
suggestions on fun shit to do.

47
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,822
- Hmm. Fun shit to do?
- Fun shit to do.

48
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:24,379
Ow! Ow!

49
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:26,579
Jesus!

50
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:28,019
Hello.

51
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:30,062
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

52
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:36,102
Oh. Another battle scar.

53
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:38,779
Kind of.

54
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:40,659
Let me guess, you were, like,

55
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:44,462
totally shark
fishing in Cape Town, dude.

56
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:47,539
Is that your
best American accent?

57
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:50,779
- Yes.
- That's pretty good. No, um...

58
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:55,902
It was courtesy of Josh Peters,
high school dick.

59
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:59,419
He and I got into a fight in shop class.

60
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:01,779
And he hit me with this,
like, metal rod thing.

61
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:04,379
What an arsehole.

62
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,139
What an arsehole.

63
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:08,299
- That's terrible.
- I'm sorry.

64
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,382
Is that you or me?

65
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,059
Oh, it's gotta be you.

66
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:17,502
"Mom." You're so American.

67
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:19,579
Yes, I am.

68
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:21,462
Are you not gonna get that?

69
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:25,819
Okay, that was a little impersonal.

70
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:28,459
What, you wanna talk to her now?

71
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:30,859
- You wanna talk to my mum? I'll call back.
- Fair point.

72
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:33,822
I don't think so.

73
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:40,982
You hungry?

74
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:50,179
Wow, look at all these games.
You're, like, a gamer. Cool.

75
00:07:50,182 --> 00:07:52,899
Of course I am. For my job.

76
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:55,619
What, a girl never beat you
at Street Fighter?

77
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:59,819
Is this... Like, this is, like,
your dating manual?

78
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:02,939
What? The Singularity?

79
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:07,139
It's when computers learn to outsmart
man like women did years ago.

80
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:09,699
Oh! Wow!

81
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:13,499
See, what I was doing, it was like a joke.

82
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:14,619
- You know?
- Really?

83
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:17,139
- Yeah.
- Well, that's what you call a joke?

84
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:19,179
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you guys have those.

85
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:22,019
- You guys have those here, right?
- Yeah, yeah. We do at the moment.

86
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:23,262
Ow!

87
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:27,622
That was a good joke. That was a good joke.

88
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:33,902
Enjoy your Marmite.

89
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,619
Whoa! Oh, my...

90
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:41,139
Do you guys seriously eat this shit?

91
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:43,819
Okay, alright.

92
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:46,179
Alright, saved by mum.

93
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:49,419
The best way to actually just
stop her from calling is...

94
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:51,419
I don't know, answer it.

95
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:55,939
Yeah, it's kind of like a can of worms
I just don't wanna open right now, so...

96
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,899
She's worried. You're her son.
You've been travelling,

97
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:02,779
and I just think if you
speak to her, then...

98
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:07,219
Yeah, well, I still live at
home with her back in Syracuse.

99
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:09,982
- That's cool. That's fine.
- Yeah.

100
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,822
I was taking care of my dad.

101
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:17,342
Oh, shit. Is he...?

102
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,659
- ...okay?
- No, he died.

103
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:21,859
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
- Last year. No, it's okay.

104
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:25,742
It was coming for a while.
It was early onset Alzheimer's.

105
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:30,059
Oh, that must have been really...
uh... tough.

106
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,502
Yeah, he was my best friend.

107
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:40,742
Sometimes he'd just look at me
and wouldn't even know who I was.

108
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:48,659
Well, my mum, like, I don't even...
I don't know how to talk to her.

109
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:52,302
You know, I don't have that connection.
I don't even know where to start.

110
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:59,662
So that's why I left.
That's why I went on this trip.

111
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:08,099
Just to get away and make, you know,
all the memories that I can...

112
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:09,462
while I can.

113
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:15,502
And I know I gotta talk to her
and I gotta just...

114
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:20,619
But not on this. You know,
I just... I'll deal with it.

115
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:24,062
I'll deal with it when I get
back, you know. I'll just...

116
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:32,142
You're a good guy, Cooper.

117
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:37,902
Call your mum.

118
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:20,979
Zero, zero, one, nine,
three, nine, two, nine.

119
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:24,819
No, I did not buy a pair of
sandals in Koh Samui last night

120
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:26,779
because I'm in...

121
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:28,862
And how long does that take?

122
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:34,659
Because I need to buy a
ticket back to America.

123
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:40,902
Oh, my God.

124
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,222
Mm-hmm.

125
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:22,379
Can I just say, this is the most blatant
cover story for a second hook-up ever?

126
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:27,139
Yes! Yes! Oh, my God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

127
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:29,419
Alright. Don't forget your bag.

128
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:33,739
The bag, yep, my bag.
Alright. You are a top bird.

129
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:37,022
I don't know what that means, but I heard
somebody say it once, and you're it.

130
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:40,539
I got a plan.

131
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,262
Yeah. It's odd jobs.

132
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:46,339
- For who?
- For, like, it's an app.

133
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:51,299
You can kind of... like, I've used it
all over when funds were low, so...

134
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,299
- Oh, there's some interesting ones.
- Pretty cool.

135
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:56,979
- "Thrillseekers wanted."
- Ooh.

136
00:12:56,982 --> 00:13:00,502
- This looks right up your street.
- Okay.

137
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:05,022
Okay, four pound signs.
That's a biggie. That's good.

138
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:07,699
It's a little out of town.

139
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:13,459
And some kind of play test deal
for a company called Saitoo...

140
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:15,499
Saitogoo...

141
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:18,139
- SaitoGemu?
- SaitoGemu. Yeah.

142
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,142
They're huge.

143
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:22,739
- They're really big.
- Really?

144
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:24,422
- Horror games?
- Uh...

145
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:29,259
Have you heard of...
Oh, what's one of theirs?

146
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:31,339
- Harlech Shadow.
- Harlech Shadow? Yes, I have.

147
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:33,819
I used to play that in my
buddy David Ludwig's basement

148
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,579
when we were, like, seventh grade.

149
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,259
Well, that's Shou Saito.
It's his company.

150
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:40,939
- He's like this genius, super secretive.
- Okay.

151
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:43,179
And apparently, they're
working on this new project.

152
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:47,059
Big money involved. Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.

153
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:53,019
Well, maybe if I play my cards right
I can get you an exclusive with Shou.

154
00:13:53,022 --> 00:13:56,059
Hmm? Fo Shou? Yeah?

155
00:13:58,262 --> 00:13:59,662
You should take a photo.

156
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:04,979
Seriously, if you get a photo of
anything that they're working on,

157
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:08,022
that's a fuckload more
money than four pound signs.

158
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:10,902
Cool.

159
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:15,462
Well, where is this place?

160
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:09,422
Mr. Copper.

161
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:13,419
Oh, hi. Um... Just Cooper.

162
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:15,499
Mr. Cooper, I apologize.

163
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:17,859
Just Cooper is fine.

164
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:20,942
Then, in that case, I'm just Katie.

165
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:23,699
- Hi.
- Hi.

166
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:25,259
- Follow me.
- Oh, yeah.

167
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:27,379
- I'll just get my pack here.
- Rav will take care of that.

168
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:31,059
Oh, Rav will take care
of that. Okay, great.

169
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,139
That's good. I don't
wanna carry it anyway.

170
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:36,739
Rav kind of reminds me of
like an end-of-level boss.

171
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:39,982
You know, haiukon. Just...

172
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:47,422
- How was your journey?
- Great. Thanks.

173
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:50,702
- The car pick you up okay?
- Yeah.

174
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:54,902
Wow.

175
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,582
This way.

176
00:16:07,022 --> 00:16:12,542
Are they... seeing? It's cool. Very cool.

177
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:16,982
Wow.

178
00:16:20,902 --> 00:16:21,942
Come on.

179
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:35,422
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.
Hope I get Gryffindor.

180
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:44,262
I'm gonna need your phone and anything
else you might use to send and receive.

181
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:48,462
- A little paranoid, don't you think?
- Can't be too careful.

182
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:51,222
Okay, there you go.

183
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:59,782
Wow, you really are
paranoid. Whoa!

184
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:02,539
It's white.

185
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,179
Um...

186
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:09,539
Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like,
I agree to have my kidneys harvested?

187
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,219
Actually, it's a pretty
standard NDA-disclaimer thing.

188
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:13,499
Okay.

189
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:16,822
It's important that you realize there
is a small medical procedure involved.

190
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:19,939
Sorry, for a game?

191
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,539
Nothing permanent and we
don't harvest your kidneys,

192
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,019
- I promise.
- Okay.

193
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:26,059
It's no more invasive than
having your ears pierced.

194
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:28,695
"Confidential information,
brain downloads

195
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,899
the game, duration, termination..."

196
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:34,859
Um... The signature page...

197
00:17:34,862 --> 00:17:36,619
- Where do I sign?
- Oh.

198
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,339
- Signature. Yeah.
- There's a page missing.

199
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:41,339
- Okay.
- Just a moment.

200
00:17:41,342 --> 00:17:45,939
Alright. I'll just wait... here.

201
00:17:55,982 --> 00:17:57,259
What the fuck?

202
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:08,459
- All good?
- All good.

203
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:13,422
What we're working on is an
interactive augmented reality system.

204
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:17,939
- Like VR?
- More like layers on top of reality.

205
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:19,142
Oh.

206
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:22,699
Okay. Um...

207
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,262
Ow.

208
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:28,219
Um...

209
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:32,142
- What's that?
- We call this a mushroom.

210
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:38,539
- Like Mario Brothers?
- If you like.

211
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:43,499
- You're qualified to do this, right?
- I haven't killed anyone yet.

212
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:44,742
May I?

213
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:47,382
Yeah.

214
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:52,622
All done.

215
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:57,342
- That was it?
- See, I told you I'm good.

216
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:07,262
- No, don't worry, it's not permanent.
- Um...

217
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:13,019
Okay. What is this, like, some kind
of memory test or something like that?

218
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:15,619
- You'll find out.
- Oh, okay.

219
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,982
You might feel a slight
twinge as it initializes.

220
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:22,222
Oh, okay.

221
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:25,902
Commencing at 5:38.

222
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:29,102
- You ready?
- Yes, sir!

223
00:19:43,822 --> 00:19:45,939
Nearly there.

224
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,182
I thought I turned that off.

225
00:19:57,542 --> 00:20:00,939
- All done. You feel okay?
- Uh-huh.

226
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:02,062
Feel great.

227
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:06,302
- Watch the targets.
- Okay.

228
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:17,022
Um...

229
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:23,739
Is...

230
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:25,742
What do you see?

231
00:20:26,782 --> 00:20:29,139
Like a... um...

232
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:31,422
Like a video game gopher.

233
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:35,019
- Is it more detailed now?
- Yeah.

234
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:36,862
Yep, yeah.

235
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:40,699
- And now?
- Holy fuck!

236
00:20:40,702 --> 00:20:43,579
Holy shit! He... Fuck. He's right...

237
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:46,139
He's right... He's right... Can I...

238
00:20:46,142 --> 00:20:47,699
Whoo!

239
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:49,899
He's not real. He's a
sort of mental projection.

240
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:53,182
- You can see him. I can't.
- You can't?

241
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:59,699
Wow! Oh, okay.

242
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:01,539
Give him a whack.

243
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:05,579
Give him a whack? Oh. Okay, alright.

244
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:15,259
Okay! Alright, so just like whack-a-mole.

245
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:17,262
- Mm-hmm.
- I've played it a million times. Okay.

246
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:20,099
Alright.

247
00:21:20,102 --> 00:21:22,899
Here we go. Come on up.

248
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:26,739
Oh! Where you coming up?

249
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,139
No. No.

250
00:21:30,142 --> 00:21:31,579
No.

251
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:36,819
Oh!

252
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:41,059
Oh!

253
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:43,262
Alright. Stay down.

254
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:46,899
Oh! Okay.

255
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:51,259
Good game. Very good game.
You are so adorable.

256
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:54,179
Okay, bye. Bye.

257
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:56,139
- Is that it?
- Afraid so.

258
00:21:56,142 --> 00:21:57,299
Oh.

259
00:21:57,302 --> 00:21:59,499
Now, were the gophers
two-dimensional or three?

260
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:04,102
Three. No, no, no.
3D, super 3D. Like... Yeah.

261
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:08,579
- Now this is just a limited test demo.
- That was a demo?

262
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:11,699
I think you should beta test the
full experience we're working on.

263
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:14,539
There'd be more money in it,
of course. If you're game?

264
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,982
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh-huh, I'm game. I'm game.

265
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:24,702
- This is Shou Saito.
- Oh!

266
00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:28,819
- You must be our latest volunteer.
- Hi.

267
00:22:28,822 --> 00:22:31,099
This is really great. Hi.

268
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:33,659
Hi.

269
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:39,222
I just... I wanted to say that
the mole game, super fun.

270
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:41,979
Super fun... fun.

271
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:45,259
- Fun?
- Fun.

272
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:47,979
- Fun is good.
- Yeah. Oh.

273
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:49,939
- Playing games is good.
- Mm.

274
00:22:49,942 --> 00:22:52,739
Your heart goes faster.

275
00:22:52,742 --> 00:22:53,939
- You smile.
- Yeah.

276
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:56,379
Yeah. Or, um... scream.

277
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:59,062
Oh!

278
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:04,299
I have always liked to
make the player jump.

279
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:07,099
Frightened. You get scared, you jump.

280
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:09,299
- Afterwards, you feel good.
- Yeah.

281
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:10,422
You glow.

282
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:13,342
Why?

283
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:16,022
Oh, um...

284
00:23:17,982 --> 00:23:20,539
Because of the adrenaline rush.

285
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:21,699
- Yes.
- Yeah.

286
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:25,942
But mostly because you are still alive.

287
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:30,739
You have faced your greatest
fears in a safe environment.

288
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:35,019
It is a release of fear.
It liberates you.

289
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:38,022
Yeah. I mean, totally.

290
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:40,819
What we are working on now

291
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:44,499
is the most personal survival
horror game in history.

292
00:23:44,502 --> 00:23:47,099
Cool.

293
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:50,659
One that works out how to scare
you by using your own mind.

294
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:55,099
Whoa. That... That sounds crazy.

295
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,059
Can't wait!

296
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,939
I'm uploading a neural net package.

297
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:02,739
Neural net packing, neural net. Hmm.

298
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,782
Name could use a little work, I think.
It's all 90s.

299
00:24:05,262 --> 00:24:07,059
I'm just kidding, it's a good name.

300
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:10,059
It's state of the art
intelligence software.

301
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:14,179
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity

302
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:16,219
and try and work out
how best to frighten you

303
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,699
and then adjust to your
experience accordingly.

304
00:24:18,702 --> 00:24:19,579
-Whoa!

305
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:21,179
- Are you ready?
- Oh, yeah.

306
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:24,342
- Beam me up. Here we go, lock and load.
- Eyes closed.

307
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:28,822
- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
- Okay.

308
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:35,902
It's uploading. Five, four,
three, two, one.

309
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:52,462
How are you feeling?

310
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:57,022
Um...

311
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:01,379
I feel good. I feel normal.

312
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:03,902
Okay. Stand up, slowly.

313
00:25:14,102 --> 00:25:15,422
Are you ready to play?

314
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:31,619
Isn't this the
Harlech Shadow house?

315
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:33,059
It's part of the estate.

316
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:36,659
The gamekeeper's lodge, actually.
But, yeah, this was the model.

317
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:40,182
The layout was replicated for
the game and the texture scanned.

318
00:25:41,062 --> 00:25:43,019
Wow!

319
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:45,022
Very, very cool.

320
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:56,699
So what's the game, what do I do?

321
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:59,779
You don't have to do anything.

322
00:25:59,782 --> 00:26:02,379
You just stay in here alone,

323
00:26:02,382 --> 00:26:05,139
see how long you last until
you're too scared to continue.

324
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:07,422
So all I have to do is,
like, stay here?

325
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:09,779
And I get paid for that?

326
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:12,499
I'll be back in the control room, watching.

327
00:26:12,502 --> 00:26:17,059
There are cameras all over,
so no stealing the silverware.

328
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:19,662
And now there's this.

329
00:26:21,982 --> 00:26:24,899
- And what's this?
- It's an earpiece.

330
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:26,139
Oh!

331
00:26:26,142 --> 00:26:28,899
Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I
will be in contact the whole time.

332
00:26:28,902 --> 00:26:30,259
Oh, cool.

333
00:26:30,262 --> 00:26:34,379
And I can, like, talk to you,
and you'll hear it? Great, that's great.

334
00:26:34,382 --> 00:26:36,619
Now, nothing you'll see
can physically harm you.

335
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:39,139
It's all just audio-visual,
like the gopher game.

336
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:40,219
Oh, okay.

337
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:43,379
But if it does get too intense,
we can pull you out at any time

338
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:45,619
- and stop the experiment.
- Okay.

339
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:47,459
Is there a safe word you can think of?

340
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:49,899
Something easy to remember in distress?

341
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,102
How about the word "stop"?

342
00:26:53,022 --> 00:26:56,419
- Good choice. "Stop" it is.
- Yeah.

343
00:26:56,422 --> 00:26:58,419
Okay, we'll leave you
to enjoy your evening.

344
00:26:58,422 --> 00:27:00,699
- Alright.
- You'll hear from me in a moment.

345
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,259
Just make yourself at home.

346
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:06,262
Okay, all right.
Well, take her easy.

347
00:27:24,742 --> 00:27:28,022
Harlech... Shadow.

348
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:52,982
Is this real? Yeah, it's real.
That's real. It's really dead.

349
00:27:57,822 --> 00:28:00,019
- Cooper.
- Oh, hey.

350
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:01,742
- Are you hearing me?
- Loud and clear.

351
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,019
Oh!

352
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:06,702
Reaching for the Dutch
courage already, I see.

353
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:15,099
- I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.
- Lame.

354
00:28:15,102 --> 00:28:20,142
- Well, we need you with a clear head.
- Okay. Fair point. Fair point.

355
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:25,262
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.

356
00:28:26,262 --> 00:28:28,742
Yeah. It's good woodwork.

357
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,982
- That's this place.
- Full marks for observation.

358
00:28:39,902 --> 00:28:41,742
Mm-hmm! Yep!

359
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:24,182
Alright, there we go.

360
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:30,782
Ah!

361
00:29:34,502 --> 00:29:36,699
- Oh, shit.
- What's up?

362
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:38,299
I just forgot I don't have my phone.

363
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:41,102
I keep going for it,
I forget it's not in my pocket.

364
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:47,339
And there's, uh... no TV here, so...

365
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:52,459
Welcome to the 19th century.
No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi.

366
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:56,019
Yeah. No wonder people were seeing shit.

367
00:29:56,022 --> 00:29:58,219
Probably were just bored
out of their gourds.

368
00:29:58,222 --> 00:30:00,779
Well, that's the leading
theory about ghost sightings.

369
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:02,979
The mind plays tricks
when less stimulated.

370
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:05,259
Fewer distractions,
people saw more ghosts.

371
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,939
Isn't that a nice piece of info?

372
00:30:09,902 --> 00:30:11,782
Well, they got literature, though.

373
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:14,822
That's pretty sweet, right?

374
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:21,499
Oh, my God, I can't remember the
actual last time that I read a book.

375
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:24,059
To think people used
to do this on purpose.

376
00:30:24,062 --> 00:30:26,939
I know. Crazy. Why?

377
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:29,859
- You know, I don't think I've...
- Shh, alright?

378
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,939
I need to get into some old-school
shit here. Concentrate.

379
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:35,502
Pardon me.

380
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:45,739
Can I point out your heart
rate just increased?

381
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:50,379
Yeah. Well, it should have cos
there's a huge crazy spider.

382
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:51,939
You see a spider?

383
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:54,622
- You don't... you don't see that?
- No.

384
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:59,382
Don't... Don't walk. Don't...

385
00:31:07,022 --> 00:31:09,099
Holy shit!

386
00:31:09,102 --> 00:31:11,419
Tough guy like you, scared of spiders.

387
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:12,939
Yeah, I'm just not fond of them.

388
00:31:12,942 --> 00:31:15,419
It's worked out you're
an arachnophobe quickly.

389
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:17,462
It's probing for weak spots.

390
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:19,462
God damn it.

391
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:22,622
Fucker!

392
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:27,942
Yeah!

393
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:32,662
Um...

394
00:31:33,382 --> 00:31:34,779
Okay.

395
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:36,579
Yeah, well, yeah.

396
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:40,182
Whole lot more realistic
than the gopher game.

397
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:42,822
It's good. It's good graphics.

398
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:46,822
It's good, uh... Yeah.

399
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:53,382
Weak sauce.

400
00:32:15,662 --> 00:32:18,379
- What is it?
- Just...

401
00:32:18,382 --> 00:32:20,102
Nothing. Nothing.

402
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:24,982
Here with the figures.
There's a... No. There's a light on...

403
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,139
now, in the...

404
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:31,699
Can you... zoom in and... Zoom in on it?

405
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:34,099
And you can see what I'm talking about.
Whoa!

406
00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:36,059
- Cooper...
- And now there's... Shh!

407
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:41,422
There's a guy in the window.
That wasn't...

408
00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:46,262
Yeah.

409
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:50,902
And now he's gone.
Now nobody's in the window.

410
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:56,102
Which is the...

411
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:00,819
Mm-hmm.

412
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:02,659
Yeah, there's a...

413
00:33:06,622 --> 00:33:07,942
Just leaky pipes.

414
00:33:17,502 --> 00:33:21,917
I knew it. It was leaky pipes, like...

415
00:33:21,942 --> 00:33:24,899
Holy fuck!

416
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:28,979
Fuck!

417
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:34,179
Oh! Oh!

418
00:33:34,182 --> 00:33:36,982
Okay.

419
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:39,822
That got me. You got me.

420
00:33:40,782 --> 00:33:42,219
What are you seeing?

421
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:45,819
Like a creepy fucking guy.

422
00:33:45,822 --> 00:33:47,702
Wow, just...

423
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,662
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

424
00:33:55,462 --> 00:33:57,859
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.

425
00:33:57,862 --> 00:34:00,219
- It's Josh Peters! You're Josh Peters!
- Sorry?

426
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:03,779
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.

427
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:07,219
The system could be mining some of
your personal memories for texture.

428
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:09,779
Was Josh Peters someone
you were scared of?

429
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:11,419
He was a bully. I wasn't scared.

430
00:34:11,422 --> 00:34:13,462
I wasn't scared of him,
but he was a bully and...

431
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:19,979
Man! Take a couple of Krav
Maga classes and I'd be ready.

432
00:34:19,982 --> 00:34:22,979
I'd be ready!

433
00:34:27,302 --> 00:34:32,262
Kali ma! Dah!

434
00:34:32,742 --> 00:34:35,302
I'm gonna get some wine. Re-up.

435
00:34:36,262 --> 00:34:39,942
I'd offer you some, but I don't
think you can drink it so...

436
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:42,702
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

437
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:45,742
Catch ya later, Peters.

438
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:51,139
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.

439
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:55,062
I'm not like a expert or anything,
but it's kinda great.

440
00:34:56,982 --> 00:35:01,259
I was in France.
I stayed at this, like, vineyard,

441
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:05,859
and they had this wine, like,
grape-stomping festival.

442
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:08,619
Now that, that wine was good. I know that.

443
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:10,619
You're being discursive.

444
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:13,739
- What is discursive? Discursive?
- Talkative.

445
00:35:13,742 --> 00:35:16,299
- Mm-hmm.
- Rambling.

446
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:18,739
Is that a problem?

447
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,499
People sometimes talk
more when they're afraid.

448
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:23,779
Helps compensate for the fear.

449
00:35:23,782 --> 00:35:25,419
- Masks it, too.
- Oh, yeah?

450
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:28,499
Similar to when you've got
the TV on late at night.

451
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,662
The voices make you feel less alone.

452
00:35:32,902 --> 00:35:35,539
Even though you are alone.

453
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:39,742
You aren't scaring me, Katie.

454
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:41,899
Pity.

455
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:44,779
Is there like a refrigerator here?

456
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:47,459
There's some snacks in the cupboard.

457
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:51,502
Alrighty. Eenie meenie, miney...

458
00:35:52,622 --> 00:35:54,342
Mo! Alright.

459
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:56,902
Okay, ginger snaps.

460
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,062
Let's see.

461
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:02,622
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This'll do.

462
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:06,462
Now... um...

463
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:12,379
He's gonna be right behind this door
when I close it, isn't he?

464
00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:14,702
Yeah, that's how this works.

465
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:21,339
Knew it. Jump scares get pretty old...

466
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,859
Fuck!

467
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:27,462
Oh, God.

468
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:30,342
- What the hell is that?
- What do you see?

469
00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:35,102
Holy shit!

470
00:36:36,582 --> 00:36:40,102
A fucking... Uh...

471
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,259
Hard to explain.

472
00:36:42,262 --> 00:36:47,059
It's like a huge-ass spider with a
face and dicks coming out of his mouth.

473
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:48,499
It's...

474
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:51,499
Peters. Peters is inside.

475
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:57,102
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.

476
00:36:57,822 --> 00:37:01,659
Ah, Katie! Are you doing
this, or is this fucking me?

477
00:37:01,662 --> 00:37:06,219
- I think that's all you.
- I'm so fucked up!

478
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:08,462
God! Fuck!

479
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:13,099
Holy shit, you're fucking gross.

480
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:16,339
Yeah...

481
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:17,942
Sorry, can you say again?

482
00:37:19,662 --> 00:37:21,462
Katie, hello?

483
00:37:23,102 --> 00:37:24,382
Damn it, Katie!

484
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:32,462
Whenever you come back online,
just say the word.

485
00:37:33,662 --> 00:37:36,739
No, I'm not scared, just... bored.

486
00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:42,382
That you guys?

487
00:37:48,262 --> 00:37:50,979
Coming to fix the earpiece?
That's probably a good idea.

488
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:53,462
Yeah. Yeah.

489
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:09,222
Fuck it, man!

490
00:38:15,582 --> 00:38:16,822
Come on!

491
00:38:18,502 --> 00:38:19,782
You're in danger.

492
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:22,859
Sonja?

493
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:27,819
Now we're talking.
Alright, this is incredible.

494
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:32,139
This... very impressive.
I am thoroughly impressed.

495
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:35,099
I am... Wow! Wow!

496
00:38:35,102 --> 00:38:39,739
You look so real.
You're, like, just like her.

497
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:41,379
I mean, wow.

498
00:38:41,382 --> 00:38:47,299
Except... you're just
unfortunately not... um...

499
00:38:47,302 --> 00:38:50,099
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

500
00:38:50,102 --> 00:38:53,299
- Cooper, you're in danger.
- Shh! Quiet. Quiet! I need to think.

501
00:38:53,302 --> 00:38:57,019
You're fucking real.
You are real. You're real.

502
00:38:57,022 --> 00:38:59,699
- Cooper, you're in...
- You're Sonja. You're actually here.

503
00:38:59,702 --> 00:39:02,579
- Are you actually here right now?
- I'm real. I'm actually here.

504
00:39:02,582 --> 00:39:04,019
- God.
- And we have to go.

505
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:05,819
- You have to listen to me.
- How are you here?

506
00:39:05,822 --> 00:39:07,739
You know that photo that you sent me?

507
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:10,179
I dug around and apparently
Shou Saito took out a patent

508
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,699
for a computer brain interface last year.

509
00:39:13,702 --> 00:39:15,779
How are you real? I don't...

510
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:18,619
Okay, fuck. I don't...

511
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,699
They brought you here!

512
00:39:20,702 --> 00:39:23,339
You are, you're real,
and they brought you here,

513
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:26,979
and they're trying to fuck with me.
Nice try, good try.

514
00:39:26,982 --> 00:39:29,539
I get it. It's part of the test.

515
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:34,019
His patent got rejected outright. They
said it was insane, it was dangerous.

516
00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:36,021
Wow. Really? How much
are they paying you?

517
00:39:36,046 --> 00:39:38,020
Honestly. Cos you're
killing it right now.

518
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:40,979
- Have they given you something?
- Sorry, I thought you were fake.

519
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:43,499
But now I know you're real,
I'm being a really terrible host.

520
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:46,902
I got some non-alcoholic wine.
Might put us in the mood.

521
00:39:47,982 --> 00:39:51,579
- Cooper, what I want to do is...
- We'll talk about it in the kitchen.

522
00:39:51,582 --> 00:39:54,619
- Cooper!
- Sonja, relax, okay?

523
00:39:54,622 --> 00:39:57,739
Give it up. I know, the
jig's up, okay? Let it go.

524
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,019
Look, Cooper, there's more.

525
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,419
Five people have disappeared
in the past year.

526
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:05,819
All tourists, all registered
with that stupid odd jobs app.

527
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:08,819
Oh, yeah? Wow. God, that's crazy.

528
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:11,579
Whatever they're doing to you,
whatever they've done to you,

529
00:40:11,582 --> 00:40:15,819
it's dangerous, and we really
have to go now, Cooper.

530
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:18,939
Okay, okay. Alright.

531
00:40:18,942 --> 00:40:21,779
- Well, if your story's true...
- Cooper.

532
00:40:21,782 --> 00:40:24,339
- Then how'd you find me?
- What?

533
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:25,622
How'd you know where I am?

534
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:28,499
It's a games company,
I looked up the address.

535
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:29,979
Yeah, really?

536
00:40:29,982 --> 00:40:33,379
No, no, no, no. How'd you
find me here? This place.

537
00:40:33,382 --> 00:40:35,099
- I tracked you.
- You tracked me?

538
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:37,179
Yeah, with your GPS on your
phone. Find My Friends.

539
00:40:37,182 --> 00:40:40,939
Find My Friends? That would've
worked, but they took my phone.

540
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:47,539
And it's in a building, like, a mile away.
So, yeah, nice try.

541
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,819
That's right.

542
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,062
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity that!

543
00:40:54,862 --> 00:40:56,219
Look, all I'm saying is that

544
00:40:56,222 --> 00:40:58,779
I think that you could've
come up with a better story,

545
00:40:58,782 --> 00:41:02,059
it could have been funny or...

546
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:04,982
Okay, alright, don't be pissed.

547
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:08,819
Do you ever wonder how your
bank account got hacked?

548
00:41:08,822 --> 00:41:10,739
What are you doing?

549
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:14,062
- I cloned your card as you were asleep.
- Whoa. Okay.

550
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,299
Put the knife down.
What are you going to do with that?

551
00:41:16,302 --> 00:41:18,739
I drew your attention to this job.

552
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,899
Sonja, put the fucking knife
down, okay? It's not funny.

553
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:24,499
Should've called your mum, Cooper.

554
00:41:24,502 --> 00:41:27,739
- But you called me, and I led you here...
- Sonja.

555
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:29,499
- You know what?
- ...like a breadcrumb trail.

556
00:41:29,502 --> 00:41:35,019
Put the knife down. Drop the act.
Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja.

557
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:37,979
It's not fucking funny. Put the knife...

558
00:41:37,982 --> 00:41:41,659
This isn't what I signed up for.
I'm fucking done, okay?

559
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:43,782
Fuck!

560
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:51,742
What the fuck?

561
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:59,499
Oh, fuck! Oh!

562
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:08,662
Holy fuck!

563
00:42:17,382 --> 00:42:18,462
Stop!

564
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:39,539
Fuck!

565
00:43:13,942 --> 00:43:18,862
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

566
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,619
- Cooper.
- Katie!

567
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:44,019
- Katie!
- Cooper.

568
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:45,339
- Katie!
- Cooper, what's happening?

569
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:47,499
What the fuck happened?

570
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:49,579
What's happening? We've been talking.
You've not been responding.

571
00:43:49,582 --> 00:43:52,899
- You said I wouldn't feel anything!
- What are you seeing? What's there?

572
00:43:52,902 --> 00:43:56,019
- Fuck! She's gone now.
- Who's gone?

573
00:43:56,022 --> 00:43:58,859
Oh, my God, I-I felt it.

574
00:43:58,862 --> 00:44:01,539
There's a knife in my arm!

575
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:04,539
- In my shoulder.
- Cooper, who was there?

576
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:06,779
- Fuck... Sonja.
- Who?

577
00:44:06,782 --> 00:44:11,099
Sonja. She's this girl that I know,
that fucking... She stabbed me.

578
00:44:11,102 --> 00:44:14,219
- She had a fucking knife.
- Nothing can harm you, Cooper.

579
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:18,419
- No, no, no, no. She was solid.
- No, she can't have been.

580
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,899
She... I was stabbed! I would know!

581
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:24,459
Nothing you see can
harm or even touch you.

582
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:26,219
It's purely audio-visual.

583
00:44:26,222 --> 00:44:29,539
- There's no physical sensation.
- Fuck! Yes, there was!

584
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:34,899
- Cooper, you need to calm down.
- I know because I felt it, okay?

585
00:44:34,902 --> 00:44:38,099
I felt her arm, it was warm,

586
00:44:38,102 --> 00:44:41,339
and I felt her fucking
stab me in the shoulder.

587
00:44:41,342 --> 00:44:44,619
- That's not possible.
- Oh, my God.

588
00:44:44,622 --> 00:44:47,859
- It's not possible, Cooper.
- Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

589
00:44:47,862 --> 00:44:51,019
Physical sensations
shouldn't be possible.

590
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,899
- Unless, I mean...
- Oh, God. Unless what?

591
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:56,939
I don't know. The neuron net,
it could have maybe worked out

592
00:44:56,942 --> 00:44:59,499
some means of replicating
physical experiences,

593
00:44:59,502 --> 00:45:02,699
- but that would be unprecedented.
- Jesus Christ.

594
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:04,859
Okay, you know what? Stop the game.

595
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:07,339
I want out. Just pull me out now.

596
00:45:07,342 --> 00:45:10,579
Stop, stop, stop. Safe
word. Fucking stop!

597
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,539
- Okay, okay, just let us work it out.
- Oh, God.

598
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:15,659
No, I want this fucking thing out now.

599
00:45:15,662 --> 00:45:18,139
Cooper, do not attempt
to remove that yourself.

600
00:45:18,142 --> 00:45:20,059
Removing it yourself
is extremely dangerous.

601
00:45:20,062 --> 00:45:21,939
Stop that, that could kill you!

602
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:23,139
Just stay calm!

603
00:45:23,142 --> 00:45:25,259
Is that Shou?

604
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:27,019
Is that Shou? What's he saying?
What's he saying?

605
00:45:27,022 --> 00:45:29,659
Okay, Cooper. We're gonna
commence with deactivation.

606
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:31,419
Oh, that's great news.

607
00:45:31,422 --> 00:45:35,459
We need you to follow instructions
and make it to the access point.

608
00:45:35,462 --> 00:45:39,702
The access point? Great.
Where the fuck's the access point?

609
00:45:42,382 --> 00:45:47,419
- Oh, fuck! More stairs? Come on!
- Just one more level.

610
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:50,542
- Trust me.
- Okay.

611
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,422
Left at the top.

612
00:45:54,862 --> 00:45:57,022
- Okay, which door?
- Room at the end.

613
00:46:01,382 --> 00:46:02,702
What is it?

614
00:46:03,942 --> 00:46:07,419
There's gonna be something
behind there. I can feel it.

615
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:09,499
- Something like...
- Like what?

616
00:46:09,502 --> 00:46:13,019
Some personal fucked-up shit.

617
00:46:13,022 --> 00:46:16,379
Like... I don't know, I could
feel it digging around in my head.

618
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:18,219
Cooper, get to the door.

619
00:46:18,222 --> 00:46:22,219
It's gonna be like my mum,
I don't know, dead.

620
00:46:22,222 --> 00:46:25,459
- Your mum?
- Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.

621
00:46:25,462 --> 00:46:28,182
- Your mother is not in there.
- You're not in control of this!

622
00:46:29,062 --> 00:46:32,059
It's in my head. It
fucking knows. It knows.

623
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:34,339
- It knows!
- It knows what?

624
00:46:34,342 --> 00:46:36,499
It knows I got this thing with my mum.

625
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,339
Cooper, I promise you,
she's not in there.

626
00:46:39,342 --> 00:46:41,619
- Now open the door.
- Oh, my God.

627
00:46:41,622 --> 00:46:44,779
It's the only way I can
get you out. Listen to me.

628
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:48,022
Okay, Okay. Fuck. Okay.

629
00:46:48,742 --> 00:46:51,939
Whatever's in there cannot harm you.

630
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,899
But I can't get you out unless
you open that door, Cooper.

631
00:46:54,902 --> 00:46:55,899
Okay.

632
00:46:55,902 --> 00:46:57,819
Would you kindly open the door?

633
00:46:57,822 --> 00:47:00,462
Here we go. Here we go.

634
00:47:16,022 --> 00:47:18,582
Okay.

635
00:47:19,782 --> 00:47:24,779
Okay, okay, I'm in the room.
Where's the access point?

636
00:47:24,782 --> 00:47:26,702
Access point?

637
00:47:27,662 --> 00:47:30,779
- There is no access point.
- What?

638
00:47:32,022 --> 00:47:33,819
I'm fucking with you, Cooper.

639
00:47:33,822 --> 00:47:36,499
I told you to come up here to
see if we've broken you enough

640
00:47:36,502 --> 00:47:39,099
to obey instructions without question.

641
00:47:39,102 --> 00:47:41,659
- And we have.
- Oh, no, no, no.

642
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:45,179
Katie, come on. Katie, come on, let me out!

643
00:47:45,182 --> 00:47:48,139
Katie, let me out, come on! What the fuck!

644
00:47:48,142 --> 00:47:51,739
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, what are you doing to me?

645
00:47:51,742 --> 00:47:55,419
- Why are you doing this?
- You thought you'd see your mother.

646
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:58,659
- Oh, fuck!
- What does she look like?

647
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:02,702
Your mother, can you describe her face?

648
00:48:04,222 --> 00:48:05,582
Her hair colour?

649
00:48:06,262 --> 00:48:07,139
She...

650
00:48:07,142 --> 00:48:09,262
Is she tall, short, fat, thin?

651
00:48:11,342 --> 00:48:13,299
- Where did you grow up?
- She...

652
00:48:13,302 --> 00:48:16,979
What's your favourite band?
Your favourite flavour ice cream?

653
00:48:16,982 --> 00:48:19,299
The name of the girl who stabbed you?

654
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:21,939
You don't know any of
these things, do you?

655
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:23,459
Don't you think that's odd?

656
00:48:23,462 --> 00:48:25,779
It's fucking taking my memories!

657
00:48:25,782 --> 00:48:28,219
Overwriting them, technically.

658
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:30,139
Fuck.

659
00:48:30,142 --> 00:48:31,982
Look in the mirror behind you.

660
00:48:35,742 --> 00:48:37,542
Do you recognize yourself?

661
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,822
Do you even know who you're looking at?

662
00:48:44,462 --> 00:48:48,899
Soon you won't be anything.
You'll be just like your dad.

663
00:48:48,902 --> 00:48:50,739
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

664
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:52,419
- That's what really scares you, isn't it?
- Stop it.

665
00:48:52,422 --> 00:48:55,219
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- You're going the same place he did.

666
00:48:55,222 --> 00:48:56,939
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

667
00:48:56,942 --> 00:48:59,859
- You're going nowhere.
- Shut up! Shut up.

668
00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:04,299
 You should have
called mum. She's all that's left.

669
00:49:04,302 --> 00:49:07,339
- You abandoned her.
- No, no, no, no!

670
00:49:07,342 --> 00:49:09,299
Get out of my head!

671
00:49:09,302 --> 00:49:11,859
You'll never see her again.
You'll never speak to her again.

672
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:14,619
- Never see her face.
- Get out of my fucking head!

673
00:49:14,622 --> 00:49:19,179
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!

674
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:23,579
You're a bad son. You'll never
see your mother again.

675
00:49:23,582 --> 00:49:25,699
You're going nowhere.

676
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:27,942
Straight into oblivion.

677
00:49:28,982 --> 00:49:31,419
You deserve it.
You should have called her.

678
00:49:31,422 --> 00:49:33,539
Get out of my fucking head!

679
00:49:35,862 --> 00:49:39,299
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

680
00:49:39,302 --> 00:49:40,779
Get it out of my fucking head!

681
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:43,459
Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?
I just need to connect.

682
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:44,782
Get it out of my head!

683
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:48,542
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

684
00:49:49,382 --> 00:49:53,219
Oh, my God. Where am I?

685
00:49:57,382 --> 00:49:59,979
Who are you?

686
00:49:59,982 --> 00:50:02,699
I can't stop it.

687
00:50:05,262 --> 00:50:10,579
I don't know who I am.
So I... So I need to go home.

688
00:50:10,582 --> 00:50:13,462
The interface has data tendrils like roots.

689
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:17,219
They've dug in deeper
than they're meant to.

690
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:21,262
Threaded through your brain,
taken over whole areas, I can't stop it.

691
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:24,382
I can't remove it, and I can't stop it.

692
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:29,022
But I...
But I don't know who I am.

693
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:34,342
I don't know... I don't know who I am.

694
00:50:37,782 --> 00:50:40,139
I don't know who I am.

695
00:50:40,142 --> 00:50:41,419
I don't know.

696
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:46,222
On behalf of Saito Game Team,
I most humbly apologize.

697
00:50:48,622 --> 00:50:53,582
Who are you?
What have you done to me?

698
00:50:54,662 --> 00:50:58,022
- What have you done to me?
- Put him with the others, please.

699
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:01,459
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

700
00:51:01,462 --> 00:51:03,779
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop, stop!

701
00:51:03,782 --> 00:51:07,179
Stop, stop, stop, stop! No, don't, don't!

702
00:51:07,182 --> 00:51:11,299
Don't! Don't!

703
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:13,499
Stop! Stop!

704
00:51:14,942 --> 00:51:16,342
No!

705
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,702
Oh, fuck.

706
00:51:22,582 --> 00:51:23,902
That was one second.

707
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:30,419
Either he's super susceptible to this or
the software is way too powerful still.

708
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:34,819
It's jumped from zero to
18K in five milliseconds...

709
00:51:34,822 --> 00:51:40,259
I'm sorry. The experience was
more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper.

710
00:51:40,262 --> 00:51:42,302
I hope you can forgive us.

711
00:51:54,662 --> 00:51:56,739
...all luggage under
the seat in front of you.

712
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:59,459
All electronic devices should
now be turned off and stowed

713
00:51:59,462 --> 00:52:03,222
as they may interfere with the aircraft's
navigational and communication....

714
00:52:27,062 --> 00:52:28,182
Mum?

715
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,822
Mum?

716
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,342
I have to call him.

717
00:53:18,302 --> 00:53:19,462
Mum?

718
00:53:21,262 --> 00:53:23,222
Why did Cooper go?

719
00:53:24,022 --> 00:53:27,462
- I...
- Mom, I'm right here. I'm...

720
00:53:30,462 --> 00:53:34,782
- I'm right here, Mum.
- I have to call Cooper.

721
00:53:36,942 --> 00:53:39,622
I have to call and
make sure that he's safe.

722
00:53:40,662 --> 00:53:44,662
I have to call him. I have to call him.
I have to call him.

723
00:53:53,182 --> 00:53:54,622
Mum?

724
00:53:58,222 --> 00:54:00,619
Mum!

725
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:04,099
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!
