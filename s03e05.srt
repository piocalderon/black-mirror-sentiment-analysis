00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,220
Okay, my people!
Rise and shine. Get up, Stripe.</i>

4
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,900
Hey. You awake yet?

5
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,020
- Sure as shit ain't dreaming no more.
- Company!

6
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,900
Something went down last night
in Her Falls,

7
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,300
a village about three miles east.

8
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,740
We've got reports of a food store
broken into, shit stolen.

9
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,140
Locals think it's roaches.

10
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,460
Roaches!

11
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,540
We head out in five minutes. Let's go!

12
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,460
Hey, so, it looks like you're getting
your first real-live roach hunt, huh?

13
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,940
Hey, new!

14
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,020
New!

15
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,940
It's Stripe.

16
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,140
Here's a little tip just in case
you get your first toe-to-toe

17
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,780
- with one of them roaches today.
- Uh-huh?

18
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,300
When you see one right here,

19
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
try not to shit your pants.
It's only gonna piss them off.

20
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,740
- I'll try.
- Try to ignore Len.

21
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,180
His aim's so bad,
he's the only guy on Earth

22
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,340
who could shit his own pants and miss.

23
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,740
- Fuck you, farm girl.
- Farm girl?

24
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,900
Yeah. Hunting's in my blood.

25
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,940
Some of us are naturals.

26
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,820
Moving out!

27
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,620
Whoo! Yeah!

28
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

29
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,820
You can speak now.

30
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,020
- <i>It must have been roaches.</i>
- Roaches, you see them? You see?

31
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,180
<i>I didn't see them.</i>

32
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,420
<i>I heard them.
All the mess. It must have been them.</i>

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,700
Want a cookie?

34
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,180
- Here you go.
<i>- They've been in the food.</i>

35
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,020
<i>We'll have to destroy
everything they left.</i>

36
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,980
<i>No one will eat it.</i>

37
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,460
We can replace that, okay?

38
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,740
<i>They destroyed the cooler.
Broke it and took the parts.</i>

39
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,540
The cooler?
They stole parts from the cooler?

40
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,460
Which way did they go?

41
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,900
<i>There were footprints
in the dirt leading that way.</i>

42
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,140
Parn Heidekker.

43
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,660
Parn Heidekker.

44
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,700
Heidekker? Is that a name?

45
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,420
Stop them coming. Please, you must stop.

46
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,420
Okay.

47
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,980
I have child who is scared.

48
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
I will. I promise.

49
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,460
Stripe!

50
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,460
Okay. Our friend here thinks
that the roaches

51
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,300
went in the direction
of Parn Heidekker's place.

52
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,660
Local oddball, seems to be some kind
of religious freak.

53
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,060
Anderson, Hague, I want you
to stay here and help them torch the food,

54
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,540
keep them calm and reassured.

55
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,900
The rest of you,
we're gonna drop in on Heidekker.

56
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,900
Ask some questions,
sniff around the place.

57
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,740
If there's roaches,
we show we're ready for them. Let's go.

58
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,860
So Mr. Heidekker is not exactly
what you call a socialite or a mingler.

59
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,380
Seems like mental health issues.

60
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,180
He's got some interesting views
on roaches, by all accounts.

61
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm putting his info
in your Mass system now.

62
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,940
Been complaints lodged against him
going months back.

63
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,300
Locals claim that he let roaches
cross his land, left food out for them.

64
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,060
Could be just shit talk
from the local villagers though so...

65
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,620
Yo, how many roaches
we got left out here?

66
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,660
A couple of thousand?
A couple of hundred, if that?

67
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,580
I mean, back home we had millions, man.

68
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,620
It only took two years
to get shit back on track.

69
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,500
Out here you got rustic fucks
throwing them scraps.

70
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,580
No wonder it's taken so long
to mop shit up.

71
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,060
But how can anyone be dumb enough
to help a fucking roach?

72
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,420
Hell, yeah.

73
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,020
Portals front and rear.

74
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,180
Windows blacked out.

75
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,020
Chimney smoke. Someone's home.

76
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,900
Lennard, you use the boomer.

77
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,380
Okay, Mass check. Everyone got the layout?

78
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,500
- Check.
- Check.

79
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,780
Check.

80
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,100
Aikin, Valcon, Coach,
you check the outbuildings here.

81
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,660
Take them one at a time and slow.

82
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,420
Stripe, Raiman,
you come with me and Lennard.

83
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,860
We go in here.

84
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,740
Len and I will talk to Heidekker,
you check the rest of the house.

85
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,260
Okay.

86
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,420
Optimal outcome, no shots fired.

87
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,740
Except on a roach.

88
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,860
Except on a roach.

89
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,380
Morning, sir.

90
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,660
There's no need for this.
I speak your language.

91
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,020
Okay.

92
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,340
- What is it you want?
- Just to talk.

93
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,780
That's what we're doing.

94
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,820
Be a little more neighbourly
if we did it inside.

95
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,900
Check the upstairs rooms.

96
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,500
Relax. I'm not your enemy.

97
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,340
Where are they?

98
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,540
Where are who?

99
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,220
You know, we got a whole bunch

100
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,460
of frightened, angry people
in that village.

101
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,980
Roaches have been breaking
into the food stores, stealing supplies.

102
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,220
You know anything about that?

103
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
No.

104
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,700
See, it's not just what they stole.

105
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,420
All that food left is gonna be destroyed.

106
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,420
- No one's gonna eat it.
- Stripe.

107
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,780
Makes life harder for everyone.

108
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,820
Cross on the wall there.
You got principles.

109
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,020
Think all life is sacred. And I get it.

110
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,100
I agree. All life is sacred so...

111
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,300
you even got to protect the roaches.
Right?

112
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,220
It's not their fault they're like that.
They didn't ask for this.

113
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,700
I get it. We get it.

114
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,500
Mm-hmm.

115
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,020
There's shit
in their blood that made them that way.

116
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,660
The sickness they're carrying.

117
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,780
That doesn't care about
the sanctity of life

118
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,020
or the pain
about who else is gonna suffer.

119
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,940
We don't stop the roaches,
in five, ten, 20 years from now,

120
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,860
you're still gonna get kids born that way,
and then they're gonna breed.

121
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,260
Bingo.

122
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,820
And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.

123
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,660
That sickness,
and it could have been avoided.

124
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,900
Fucking roach nest.

125
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,820
You check in there. I'll take the stairs.

126
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,780
Every roach you save today,

127
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,940
you condemn God knows how many people
to despair and misery tomorrow.

128
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,100
You can't still see them as human.

129
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,940
Understandable sentiment, granted,
but it's misguided.

130
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,460
We gotta take them out if humankind
is gonna carry on in this world.

131
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,580
That's just the hard truth.

132
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,620
Gotta make sacrifices.

133
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,460
What the fuck?

134
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,020
Help me out here!

135
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Fuck!

136
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:40,420
<i>♪ Try to shame me and still I'll care ♪</i>

137
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,420
<i>♪ You can run around, even put me down ♪</i>

138
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,540
<i>♪ I'll still be there for you ♪</i>

139
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,780
Rai!

140
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,260
We gotta listen to Mr. Sunday School
all the way back to base?

141
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,900
You can cover your ears.

142
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,100
Yeah, or, uh....
I'll just hit permanent mute.

143
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,020
Lower your weapon.

144
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,940
Roach lover counts as a kill too, right?

145
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,860
He's a civ, right?

146
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,300
You shoot a civ, that's gonna stay
with you the rest of your life.

147
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,660
Yo, Stripe, why don't you, uh...
pull the stick out of your ass?

148
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,500
Because I'm fucking with him, not you.

149
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,860
I guess I had you both going, right?

150
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,940
All right!

151
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,300
Let's torch the place.

152
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,740
Hey, you okay, man?

153
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,700
Yeah.

154
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,740
- I heard you popped one in there.
- Two.

155
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,780
Wait, two?

156
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,900
- I got another one, with my knife.
- With your knife? Holy shit!

157
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,780
- Pretty good, right?
- Yeah, you fucking Terminator.

158
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Damn! First time out, he gets two.

159
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,300
You lucky motherfucker, man.

160
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,820
Sweet dreams for this asshole.

161
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,540
Gonna get a treat tonight.

162
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,500
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

163
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,180
I love you.

164
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,100
Whoa! Miss Sharp Shooter.

165
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,620
Patronising fuck!

166
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:16,300
_

167
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,980
Ruthless! You're the Grim Reaper.

168
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,500
Yeah, well, no roach gets away next time.

169
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,500
Are you still sweating that?

170
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,380
Well, I grew up tracking deer.
You never give up.

171
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,740
I don't like it when they get away.

172
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:34,220
_

173
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,340
Nice.

174
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,180
Yeah,
if that fucker made it to the forest,

175
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,780
probably made it to the border,
gone for good.

176
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,380
Yeah. It's all right for you.

177
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,260
You popped two of 'em.

178
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,260
It's been a while for me.

179
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,660
You know, the gal is getting twitchy.

180
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,340
Come on, Rai.

181
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,940
You sleep good?

182
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,100
Yeah, I slept OK.

183
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,860
What, that's all you're gonna give me?

184
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,940
Okay? You know, if I got two in one go,

185
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,820
I would want to come for like an hour!

186
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,100
All right, shut up.

187
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,900
All right.

188
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,780
Ah! That's the way.

189
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,820
Hey, you okay, man?

190
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,620
Yeah, think I'm tired is all.

191
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,460
Uh-huh?
All right, so you did have a good night.

192
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,380
39, 40, 41....

193
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,820
42...

194
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,580
43, 44, 45, 46,

195
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,060
47, 48, 49,

196
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,140
50, 51, 52,

197
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,540
53, 54, 55,

198
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,300
56, 57, 58, 59...

199
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,820
Strong and pure.

200
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,620
Strong and pure.

201
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,620
- Hey, Stripe, you okay?
- Yeah.

202
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,860
I mean, I... don't know.

203
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,580
I feel a little off.

204
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,860
I mean, I ain't sick or nothing.
It's just, uh...

205
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,700
Report to the sick bay.

206
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,020
Running diagnostic.

207
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,460
What do you see?

208
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,500
A cube.

209
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,740
- Rotating?
- Yeah.

210
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,740
- And now?
- A tree.

211
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,380
- Like an apple tree.
- Touch the apples for me.

212
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,780
Full marks.

213
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,700
- So you say you had like a headache?
- Yeah, but just quick.

214
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,140
Nothing big, just...

215
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,940
Well, everything looks okay.

216
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,620
No sign of any malfunction
or dropout with your Mass implant.

217
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,580
And physically,
you're in exemplary shape.

218
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,260
You've just seen combat,
you can expect some sort of side effect.

219
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,700
There was this, uh... this thing...

220
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,740
with a light on it at the farmhouse.

221
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,100
- Roach had it.
- A roach had it?

222
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,460
- Kind of like a flashlight.
- Flashlight?

223
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Kinda.

224
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,260
I don't know.

225
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,660
Seriously, you're fine. Your Mass is fine.
Blood's fine. It's all fine.

226
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,700
Okay. Yeah.

227
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,100
Maybe you should speak to Arquette.

228
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,580
Who's Arquette?

229
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,900
So, you must be Koinanchey?

230
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,100
Koinange. Folks call me Stripe.

231
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,700
Why would they call you that?

232
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,260
Couldn't pronounce Koinange either,
I guess.

233
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,980
- That's funny.
- Thank you.

234
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,780
At ease, son. Sit down.

235
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,980
So you recently logged your first kills?

236
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,900
- Two roaches?
- Uh-huh.

237
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,540
First time out. It's impressive.

238
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,820
Yeah, I guess.

239
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,660
So what happened?

240
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,980
- What, with the kills?
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,300
Oh. I'm in this, uh... farmhouse.

242
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,980
There's this, like,
hidden room or something.

243
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,420
We go in and there they are.

244
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,820
First one, I just... It was automatic.
Just pop-pop, you know?

245
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,260
Right. Just like in training.

246
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,220
Yeah, just like that, yeah. Yeah.

247
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,460
- And the second?
- I mean, he was on the ground with me.

248
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,780
He?

249
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,780
It was a he.

250
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,340
Oh.

251
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,860
So, this was close quarters then?

252
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,260
Yeah, he's on top of me.
Struggling, I mean...

253
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,220
I couldn't reach my rifle
so I had to stick him.

254
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,900
Stick it. With my knife.

255
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,260
And how did that... feel?

256
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,740
- What, like...?
- Emotionally.

257
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,900
I didn't. I mean, it was quick.
It was self-protection.

258
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,620
I guess all I felt was, you know, relief.

259
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,820
- Just relief?
- Uh-huh.

260
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,580
It's not unusual to experience
other feelings too.

261
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,140
A moment of euphoria even.

262
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,660
Yeah, I guess.

263
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,260
I don't know,
I thought maybe I'd feel...

264
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,580
I don't know.

265
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,340
- Something else?
- Yeah, like...

266
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,380
Regret. Something like that,
but that just wasn't there.

267
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,540
Hmm.

268
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,860
So you'd do it again?

269
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,540
Yeah, sure.

270
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,300
So... why are you here?

271
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,980
I don't know. I mean...

272
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,460
I had a few weird moments.

273
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,380
My Mass looked like it was glitching out.

274
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,420
But your implants,
I mean, they passed every diagnostic.

275
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,980
- There is nothing wrong with that?
- Yeah, they said it's fine.

276
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,620
I don't know, I think I just...

277
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,100
Felt like something was up with it.

278
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,060
- But there's not.
- No.

279
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,340
You did a big thing.
You should be proud of yourself.

280
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,700
Okay?

281
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,500
It'll pass.

282
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,300
Let's get you a good sleep tonight, huh?

283
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,380
A real good sleep.

284
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,060
Fuck me.

285
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,900
Way to go, fuck fingers.

286
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,140
It seems Heidekker didn't stay silent
too long once we got to work on him.

287
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,540
He's given up a location, someplace
the roaches have been scavenging.

288
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,860
Well, all right.

289
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,020
It's a housing project
that's been empty since the war.

290
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,180
It's not far from here.

291
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,380
So control wants us to do recon
before we go back to base.

292
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,900
Can we hurry it up here?

293
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,460
We ought to burn the whole forest down,
huh?

294
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,300
Give those roaches nowhere to run.

295
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,300
Okay, you see that?

296
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,140
Solar panel looks cleaner than the rest.

297
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,220
And there are some cables.

298
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,980
- There's got to be roaches leaching power.
- Why here?

299
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,660
Christ knows.

300
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
All right.

301
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,300
Better dial it in.

302
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,860
Control. This is Medina.

303
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,180
Positive ID. Signs of activity here
at the housing project location.

304
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:11,180
Sighted one solar panel, looks
recently wiped clean and some cabling.

305
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,860
Roger so far.

306
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,700
- You all right there?
- Smell the grass.

307
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,660
We can't usually smell nothing.

308
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,180
- You ever noticed that?
- No, I never noticed that.

309
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,300
Requesting course of action.

310
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,100
Didn't read. Please repeat.

311
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Okay.

312
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,660
Control says we should fall back
and await comm...

313
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,300
Shit!

314
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,900
Medina.

315
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,700
Oh!

316
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,260
Medina.

317
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,060
Stripe, get back! She's dead. Come on!

318
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,940
Okay. Ready? Cover me.

319
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,420
Rai! Rai, come on.

320
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,020
Okay.

321
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,900
Oh, fucking roach got a rifle.
Jesus Christ.

322
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,140
Fuck. Piece of shit.

323
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,060
Okay, Stripe.

324
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,580
Stripe, come on. Get it together, dude.

325
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,980
He fired six shots.
His rifle looks old, bolt action.

326
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,300
- Should take him ten seconds to reload.
- We go in?

327
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,780
We go in and take him out.
Are you with me?

328
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,900
- I'm with you.
- Let's go!

329
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,100
Follow me!

330
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,540
Ready? Okay, three, two, one. Cover me.

331
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,700
Come on, man! What the fuck?

332
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,220
What the fuck is this shit?

333
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,980
Let's go.

334
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,540
Stripe!

335
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,540
Whoa, whoa! It's okay. Hey. Hey.

336
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,620
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

337
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,660
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

338
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,740
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

339
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,460
Go on, get out of here. Go on.

340
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,980
It's not safe. There's roaches here.

341
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,420
Go on. Get.

342
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,100
Come on!

343
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,460
- Rai, what did you do?
- Shut up! Come on!

344
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,500
What did you do, Rai?

345
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,180
Got ya.

346
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,300
Rai!

347
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,780
No!

348
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,700
- Run!
- What the fuck are you doing?

349
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,820
- You're killing them!
- They're roaches!

350
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,620
You're fucking killing them, Rai!
Fuck you!

351
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,180
What the fuck's wrong with you, man?
You got some blown shit.

352
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,140
- Pull it together!
- No.

353
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,300
Are you all right?

354
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,380
You gotta get out of here. Come on.

355
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,300
Come on!

356
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,180
Fuck!

357
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,860
You better run.

358
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,380
Shh. Shh.

359
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,780
Here.

360
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
I'm all right.

361
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,780
You see me as I am.

362
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,300
Of course I see you.

363
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,420
You don't see roach?

364
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,300
You ain't a roach.

365
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,260
Roaches is all...

366
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,340
Fucked up?

367
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,020
Roaches don't speak.

368
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,340
You just can't hear us.

369
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,020
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Your implants. Your army implants.

370
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,780
The Mass system?

371
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,180
They put it in your head to help you fight,

372
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,220
and when it works,
you see us as something other.

373
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:37,380
One of us, Luka,
was making a... a machine.

374
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,900
Light flashes.
Said it can interfere with the implant.

375
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,340
You're roaches?

376
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,580
But I've seen roaches.

377
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,420
I've seen them, they're fucking...
They're like, uh...

378
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,780
- Animals?
- No, they're monsters. I've seen them.

379
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,860
The implant made you see this.

380
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,300
Fuck. The villagers... Huh?

381
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:49,500
The locals, they... they ain't army.
They got no Mass in their heads.

382
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,140
They're scared of the roaches.

383
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,340
- They hate the fucking things.
- Everybody hates us.

384
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,980
Well, what the fuck do they see? Huh?

385
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,820
The fucking civs, when they look
at a roach, what do they see?

386
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,620
What you see now.

387
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,820
They hate all the same
because it's what they've been told.

388
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,740
Ten years ago, it began.

389
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,260
Post-war.

390
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,340
First, the screening programme,
the DNA checks,

391
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,820
then the register,
the emergency measures.

392
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,780
And soon everyone calls us creatures.
Filthy creatures.

393
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,780
Every voice. The TV. The computer.

394
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,460
Say we have... we have sickness in us.

395
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,460
We have weakness. It's in our blood.

396
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,380
They say that our blood cannot go on.

397
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,620
That we cannot go on.

398
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,020
My name was Catarina.

399
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,460
He was Alec.

400
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,260
Now we're just roach.

401
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,100
But now...

402
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,660
Now you see me.

403
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,380
Now you see me.

404
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,300
Rai?

405
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,620
Rai, no!

406
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,620
Tell me I shouldn't kill you.

407
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,180
- None of it's true, Rai.
- What the fuck got you?

408
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,500
None of it's true.

409
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,460
Fuck you.

410
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,580
Get up. Back against the wall.

411
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,540
Get up!

412
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,300
You want me to come in there?

413
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,060
It's all right. I can just talk to him.

414
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,020
Thank you, Briley.

415
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,380
Stripe.

416
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,980
We owe you an apology.
We didn't spot the fault in your Mass.

417
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,820
I got you a coffee.

418
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,900
The device you found in the farmhouse,
you mentioned it to the doctor.

419
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,900
Is this the thing?

420
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,180
We found it on an old block
that you and Raiman were searching.

421
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,740
Looks like they reverse engineered it
from some of our drone parts and so on.

422
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:48,060
The light here transmits a code.
It's like a virus.

423
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:51,180
It burrows into your Mass,
trying to shut it down from within.

424
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,140
I tell you, those roaches
are getting more ingenious

425
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,460
than we give them credit for.

426
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,900
The whole thing is a lie.

427
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,780
I understand why you'd say that, yeah.

428
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,180
Roaches.

429
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,220
They look just like us.

430
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,500
Of course they do.

431
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,540
That's why they're so dangerous.

432
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,780
Humans.
You know, we give ourselves a bad rap,

433
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,860
but we're genuinely empathetic
as a species.

434
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,940
I mean, we don't actually really want
to kill each other.

435
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,940
Which is a good thing.

436
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,540
Until your future depends
on wiping out the enemy.

437
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,860
Come on, sit down.

438
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,220
I don't know how much history
you studied in school.

439
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,860
Many years ago,
I'm talking early 20th century,

440
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,900
most soldiers
didn't even fire their weapons.

441
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,620
Or if they did, they would just aim
over the heads of the enemies.

442
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,940
They did it on purpose.

443
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,300
British Army. World War I.

444
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,820
The brigadier,
he'd walk the line with a stick

445
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,780
and he'd whack his men
in order to get them to shoot.

446
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,820
Even in World War II, in a firefight,

447
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,900
only 15%, 20% of the men
would pull the trigger.

448
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,380
The fate of the world at stake
and only 15% of them fired.

449
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,060
Now what does that tell you?

450
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,340
It tells me that that war
would have been over a whole lot quicker

451
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,820
had the military got its shit together.

452
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,300
So we adapted.

453
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,540
Better training. Better conditioning.

454
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,140
Then comes the Vietnam War,

455
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,100
and the shooting percentage goes up to 85.

456
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,700
Lot of bullets flying.
The kills were still low.

457
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,540
Plus the guys who did get a kill,

458
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,500
well, most of them came back
all messed up in the head.

459
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,380
And that's pretty much how things stayed
until Mass came along.

460
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:14,540
You see, Mass...
Well, that's the ultimate military weapon.

461
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,020
It helps you with your intel.

462
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,780
Your targeting. Your comms.
Your conditioning.

463
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:29,060
It's a lot easier to pull the trigger
when you're aiming at the bogeyman, hmm?

464
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,100
It's not just your eyes, though.
Takes care of your other senses, too.

465
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,020
You don't hear the shrieks.

466
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,980
You don't smell the blood and the shit.

467
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,700
They're human beings.

468
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,700
Do you have any idea the amount of shit
that's in their DNA?

469
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,660
Higher rates of cancer.

470
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:58,860
Muscular dystrophy.
MS. SLS. Substandard IQ.

471
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,100
Criminal tendencies. Sexual deviances.

472
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,220
It's all there.

473
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,300
The screening shows it.

474
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,620
Is that what you want
for the next generation?

475
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,580
Don't feel bad about doing your job.

476
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,860
The villagers won't do it.

477
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,220
The folks back home won't do it.

478
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,740
They don't have Mass.

479
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,780
Mass lets you do it.

480
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,660
You.

481
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,020
You're protecting the bloodline.

482
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,140
And that, my friend, is an honour.

483
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,380
There's no honour here.

484
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,380
It's just killing.

485
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,860
- Lying and killing.
- No one lied to you.

486
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,220
You knew all of this. All along.

487
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,900
What are you talking about?

488
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,580
You agreed
to have your Mass implant put in.

489
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,540
Set up. Every soldier does.

490
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:06,060
We can't just embed it and feed you
a dream. Your mind would reject it.

491
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,420
You have to accept it. Willingly.

492
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,420
It's exactly what you did.

493
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,300
<i>So you see the terms
and conditions there?</i>

494
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,140
<i>Yeah, that's like a whole essay, man.</i>

495
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,020
What is that?

496
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,660
That's your consent video.
From when you signed up six months ago.

497
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:34,140
<i>Basically, it says you agree
to Mass implant activation.</i>

498
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,740
- I didn't do this.
- Yes, you did.

499
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,180
- <i>Works kind of like hypnosis.</i>
- <i>Yeah, all right.</i>

500
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,540
<i>Part of what you're agreeing to
is not realising</i>

501
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,020
<i>you've been put in this state.</i>

502
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,420
<i>If you follow me.
You won't recall this conversation.</i>

503
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,660
<i>That's kind of funny, man.</i>

504
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,260
Turn it off.

505
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,620
- <i>So for you to register consent...</i>
- Turn it off, man.

506
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,380
<i>I'm gonna need your thumbprint there.</i>

507
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,740
- <i>Right here?</i>
- <i>Yes, please.</i>

508
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,540
<i>That's dope.</i>

509
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,420
I didn't do that!

510
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,180
- I don't remember that!
- Just like the man said.

511
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,820
- I know you're upset.
- Fuck you!

512
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,700
- What's happening?
- We control what you see, Stripe.

513
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,900
- I can't see nothing.
- Because we control it.

514
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,500
Give me my fucking eyes back.

515
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,180
- Let me lay out your options.
- Give me my fucking eyes back, man!

516
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,460
Let me lay out your options!

517
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,660
Option one,
you agree to have your Mass reset.

518
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,820
All the recollections
of the past few days,

519
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,180
including this conversation, erased.

520
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,660
No way.

521
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,580
Option two's incarceration.

522
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,620
- I'd advise you to consider.
- Fuck you!

523
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,380
Mass is a friend.

524
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,620
Without it, you will remember
everything that you did.

525
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,500
I ain't having this Mass shit.

526
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,420
No more. No way.

527
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,620
Okay.

528
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,580
Well...

529
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,900
Maybe you should see
what life would be like without it.

530
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,380
What's happening?

531
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,020
Where am I?

532
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,340
Heidekker's ranch. Three days ago.

533
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,060
I have it all logged, Stripe.
We can feed you everything that you did.

534
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,540
Hey, no, no, no. No.

535
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,620
Please! Please don't shoot. Please!
Please! Please don't shoot.

536
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,740
- Please! Please!
- No! No!

537
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,380
No. Make it stop.

538
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,420
No! Please.

539
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,380
Make it stop!

540
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,420
Please!

541
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,380
No! No!

542
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,660
No!

543
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,020
Fuck off! Stop it!

544
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,380
No!

545
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,900
You'll see and smell and feel it all.

546
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,940
Is this what you want?

547
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:05,580
On a loop? In a cell all alone?

548
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,380
We can make that go away.

549
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,140
This conversation goes away too.

550
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,420
All of it.

551
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,700
But you gotta say the word.

552
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,860
Just say the word, Stripe.

553
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,740
And it all goes away.

554
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,020
Just say the word.

555
00:57:43,649 --> 00:57:48,961
