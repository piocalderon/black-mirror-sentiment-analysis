00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,030
Belinda Carlisle there with one
of the biggest hits of 1987 so far.

4
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,270
Gotta love that track!
Coming up next in just a moment...

5
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,350
Could you please stop it?
I just wanna have some fun, okay?

6
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,510
Kelly, come on.

7
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,030
- Kelly.
- I'm still walking, Wes.

8
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,270
We've only got a couple of hours
so let's, uh... let's use it.

9
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,350
I am using it.

10
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,390
Hey.

11
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,070
You're good at this.

12
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,390
It's, uh... got different endings.

13
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,550
Depending on if you're in one
or two player.

14
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,750
Uh-huh?

15
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,350
- It was kinda the first game to do that.
- Damn it!

16
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,550
Do you wanna play <i>Top Speed</i>?

17
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,350
Oh, no.

18
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,110
Thank you.
I just wanna get my bearings a bit.

19
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,350
Uh... okay.

20
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,230
- See you around?
- Mm-hmm.

21
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,390
Go along with whatever I say.

22
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,990
- Sorry?
- Whatever I say, go along with it.

23
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,270
Okay, Wes, you're just pestering now.

24
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,270
- Do I have to red light you?
- Two hours 35.

25
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,830
- There's not much time left.
- Wes.

26
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,910
Look...

27
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,350
- Last week, we had the most amazing...
- Last week was last week.

28
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,990
I need to talk with my friend here, okay?
Haven't seen her in a while.

29
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,670
Wes, she's sick.

30
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,670
Like "six months to live" sick.

31
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,870
Five, actually.

32
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,750
I need to catch up with her.
Private time.

33
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,950
Okay.

34
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,950
Okay.

35
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,510
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

36
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,070
See you around?

37
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,790
Sure.

38
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,950
Sorry for killing you.

39
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,990
The whole "six months to live" thing?

40
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,830
Sorry. Five.

41
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,590
Five was a nice touch.

42
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,870
- Kelly.
- Yorkie.

43
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,430
- Yurgie?
- Yorkie.

44
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,350
Like the dog breed?

45
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,310
Yeah.

46
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,310
He's not a bad guy. I feel kinda bad.

47
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,790
- Met him at the Quagmire so...
- What's the Quagmire?

48
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,750
If you don't already know
what the Quagmire is,

49
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,790
you probably don't wanna know.

50
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,870
No?

51
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,070
You want another one?

52
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,950
- Oh, no, I...
- Yeah, you do. Come on.

53
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,710
Do I have to tug your leash?

54
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,670
- Hey, Blondie.
- I'm Blondie?

55
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,030
You are. Jack and Coke times two.

56
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,270
- Oh, no. Mine was just a Coke.
- Times two.

57
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,670
- What are you doing?
- I'm... regarding you.

58
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,110
I feel like I'm being analysed.

59
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,030
- Why the glasses?
- Um...

60
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,430
I like them. They totally work on you.
But do you need them?

61
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,190
- Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.
- Knew it!

62
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,590
I used to wear them in school.

63
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,790
So I guess now
they're just kind of a... comfort thing.

64
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,270
I figured they were
kind of a fashion statement.

65
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,790
- Really?
- But then the rest of your outfit is not.

66
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,710
Don't take that wrong.
It's refreshing. I mean, look around.

67
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,030
People try so hard to look
how they think they should look.

68
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,950
They probably saw it in some movie.

69
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,830
But I like these.

70
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,190
You're authentically you.

71
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,670
Thanks.

72
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,150
Cheers.

73
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,710
You never tasted it before?

74
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,150
No, I...

75
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,950
I just haven't had it in a while.
It's good.

76
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,710
Do you live here?

77
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,430
- No. Oh, uh...
- Tourist?

78
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,870
We'll go with tourist.
So you're new here?

79
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,750
- First night.
- First night? Wow, okay!

80
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,790
Oh, my God!

81
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,550
We <i>have</i> to dance to this.

82
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,150
- With each other?
- Uh-huh.

83
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,430
- Oh, no. Dance floors aren't my thing.
- Oh, let's not limit ourselves.

84
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,790
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can, come on.

85
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,750
- No, I'll look dumb...
- Just follow my lead!

86
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,230
Copy me.

87
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,070
You got it.

88
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,430
Hey!

89
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,910
- Why did you run away?
- Oh, sorry.

90
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,390
I... I said I'm not much of a dancer.

91
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,510
No shit.

92
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,270
Like a frightened horse
on a frozen lake back there.

93
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,510
I'm kidding. Half kidding.

94
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,550
Sorry I pushed you into it.

95
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,950
Saturday nights once a week.
It's like no time. I get impatient.

96
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,910
No, no, it's not that. It's...

97
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,390
- Everyone was looking.
- Looking?

98
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,190
Yeah. You know, two girls dancing.

99
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,310
Okay, one, folks are way less uptight
than they used to be.

100
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,070
And two, this is a party town.
No one's judging.

101
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,830
Face it. If they were staring,
it's because I am bodacious.

102
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,550
- You're stupid.
- Thank you!

103
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,550
- I've never been on a dance floor.
- Never?

104
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,710
As in the whole time
you've been alive never?

105
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,750
Never.

106
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,710
What are you, like, Amish?

107
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,990
That's one sheltered existence
you got there.

108
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,270
Yeah, well.

109
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,990
As far as my family's concerned,
I can't do anything.

110
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,510
Well, no one knows
about even half the shit I get up to.

111
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,310
With your folks, though,
it's from a place of love, though, right?

112
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,070
- They worry.
- They don't worry.

113
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,510
Just the concept of me enjoying myself
would blow their minds.

114
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,430
What would you like to do?
That you've never done?

115
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,390
Oh...

116
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,550
So many things.

117
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,630
San Junipero is a party town.

118
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,990
All up for grabs.

119
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,510
Midnight's two hours away.

120
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,190
Oh, that's not long.

121
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,830
Why waste time sitting here?

122
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,390
I, um...

123
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,510
- Listen...
- It's okay.

124
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,950
- No, I mean...
- Really, it's okay.

125
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,910
No, I'm, uh...
I'm engaged. I have a fiancé.

126
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,630
- He's called Greg.
- And is Greg here?

127
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,270
- No, he's...
- Elsewhere?

128
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,590
Yeah.

129
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,910
Oh.

130
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,590
Wanna go to bed with me?

131
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,150
We could be back at mine in like...

132
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,790
I never did anything like that.

133
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,230
All the more reason.

134
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,110
Oh, you're nice.

135
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,910
- I can't.
- Okay.

136
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,710
- I just... I can't.
- I get it.

137
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,830
- I have to go.
- In this?

138
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,870
It's been really great to meet you.

139
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,550
Likewise.

140
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,350
Okay.

141
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,870
Okay.

142
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,910
Okay.

143
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,830
Shit.

144
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:17,187
_

145
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,870
- What the hell, Wes?
- Look, I know I'm coming across...

146
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,670
- I'm red lighting you, for real. Okay?
- No, don't do that. Just...

147
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,390
- Then stop this.
- Can you hear me out? Please? Please.

148
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,030
How many girls do you think there are
in San Junipero?

149
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,630
Hundreds? Thousands?

150
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,750
I don't care.

151
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,430
I'm saying there's plenty
of other girls out there for you, Wes.

152
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,830
The locals? They're like dead people.

153
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,990
A little lively for dead people.

154
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,670
Look, I don't want some kind
of boring romance, okay?

155
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,550
Like, Jesus,
put us in a retirement home deal.

156
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,070
Well, if you're looking for someone
to fuck, there's options.

157
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,510
- Hang out at the Quagmire again.
- It's not just sex.

158
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,590
- It was just sex.
- No, we made a connection.

159
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,470
Wes, it was just sex.

160
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,790
- No...
- No roots.

161
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,150
We had fun.

162
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,750
I'm sorry.

163
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,030
Enjoy the town, for God's sake.

164
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,310
- Hey.
- Hey.

165
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,150
Waiting for someone?

166
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,910
Not really.

167
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,030
I'll get you a drink?

168
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,110
Uh, yeah, sure.

169
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,230
So, uh... yeah,
it was microsurgery, I guess.

170
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,110
You know, both my kneecaps
had kind of just worn down.

171
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,430
You know, I never got this song.
Kind of weird.

172
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,590
- Shall we dance?
- Sure.

173
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,950
I mean, I guess by the time
I'd put my mind to, like, computing.

174
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,510
You know, caught that first wave,
would have had a different story.

175
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,750
Gotta use the bathroom.

176
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,750
Okay.

177
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,870
- I don't know how to do this.
- Do what?

178
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,510
Just help me.

179
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,670
Can you just...

180
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,310
Just make this easy for me?

181
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,790
You wanna get in my car?

182
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,790
- How long have you been here?
- Sorry?

183
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,630
- How long have you been here?
- In San Junipero?

184
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,510
Uh... Couple of months.
Plan is long enough to enjoy myself.

185
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,150
Guess I'm a tourist, like you.

186
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,270
Yeah.

187
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,550
Hey. You okay?

188
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,590
Yeah.

189
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,270
Stop!

190
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,990
Sorry, but...

191
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,910
Man, your face!

192
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,670
Wow.

193
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,670
- You like it?
- It's just so big.

194
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,430
Reminds me of where I grew up.

195
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:44,381
_

196
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,150
Miss your mom?

197
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,870
You have to show me.

198
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,150
- Okay.
- Okay.

199
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,310
You never slept with a woman before?

200
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,510
That's not a critique.
I mean, it was fucking awesome.

201
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,910
No, never with a woman.

202
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,550
Never with anyone.

203
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,510
Not anyone?

204
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,470
- What, in town or...?
- No. No one, nowhere.

205
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,310
- I guess you deflowered me.
- I deflowered you?

206
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,270
What is this? Merry England?

207
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,590
Shut up.

208
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,670
You've had relationships though.

209
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,550
Mnh-mnh.

210
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,630
Hello! You got a fiancé.

211
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,230
- It's complicated.
- Yeah, I'll say.

212
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,590
When did you know...

213
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,150
- that you liked women?
- I like men too.

214
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,870
Equal rights.

215
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,990
Okay.

216
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,230
But when did you know?

217
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,510
Do you always know?

218
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,110
I was married to a guy.
A long time, I was married.

219
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,550
I always knew.

220
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,470
I mean, I'd be attracted to other girls,

221
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:36,110
co-workers, friends,
some waitress that served me.

222
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,550
They were crushes.
God, they were crushes.

223
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,550
Never acted on any of it.

224
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,350
Never did anything.

225
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,390
I was in love with him.

226
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,390
I really was in love with him.

227
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:12,590
But he chose not to stick around.

228
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:22,710
So now it's me.
And I'm passing through.

229
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,150
And before I leave,
I'll have a good time.

230
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,550
I'm just gonna have a good time.

231
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,950
Time's nearly up.

232
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,790
Then let's lie here.

233
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,576
_

234
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,790
Excuse me?

235
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,070
Have you seen Kelly?

236
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,990
- What's that?
- Kelly.

237
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,430
I haven't seen her all night.

238
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,270
You tried the Quagmire?

239
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,190
What is the Quagmire?

240
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,710
- Whoa! Hey!
- I'm sorry!

241
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,590
Yeah, I know you from somewhere.

242
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,910
Tucker's.

243
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,150
- Kelly's friend, huh?
- Do you know where to find her?

244
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,790
- How would I know that?
- You're her friend.

245
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,670
- <i>Was</i> a friend.
- Has she been here?

246
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,830
No.

247
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,390
You too, huh?

248
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,550
Well...

249
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,070
Hey. Try a different time.

250
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:11,350
Here in '80, the '90s, 2002 one time.

251
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,510
She's worth the shot, right?

252
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:29,430

<i>But so is gas mileage...</i>

256
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,270
No, no, no.

257
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,470
- Hey.
- Hey.

258
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,190
Golden age, right?

259
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,550
- Right.
- You playing or...

260
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,750
I'm sorry, I'm looking for someone.

261
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,950
Maybe... next time.

262

267
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,270

270
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,870
Ladies' room.

271
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,190
Hey.

272
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,390
Hey. No, you...

273
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,510
Wait a minute.

274
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,190
Why are you here?

275
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,430
I was looking for you.
Where did you go?

276
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,190
I like a change of music.

277
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,750
How the hell is this your era?

278
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,950
- You hid from me.
- One, I did not.

279
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:16,750
Two, I owe you zero.
And three... see point two.

280
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,790
It's not about who owes who.
It's about manners.

281
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,070
You don't know who I am.

282
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,630
You don't know what this means.

283
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,830
This means fun.

284
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,870
Or it should. And this...

285
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,190
This is not fun, okay?

286
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,870
This is not fun.

287
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,670
So you don't feel bad?

288
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:56,270
Maybe you should feel bad.
Or at least feel something.

289
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,510
Have you seen a girl?
Mid-20s, brown hair, glasses?

290
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,150
Uh...

291
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,310
Oh, jeez.

292
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,270
Hey.

293
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,110
Please tell me
you got your pain slider set to zero.

294
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,270
Yeah, I think so.

295
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,350
- Okay, listen.
- How many of them are dead?

296
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,070
Like what percentage?

297
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,910
As in full-timers?

298
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,550
Eighty. Eighty-five.

299
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,310
I'm sorry.

300
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,590
- I'm not gonna jump.
- I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's...

301
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,230
In the time I've been here,
I said I wouldn't...

302
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,870
I don't know, do feelings.

303
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,430
You freaked me out.

304
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,990
I don't want to like anyone.

305
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:30,110
So you've been just...
totally fucking inconvenient.

306
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,550
It's that...

307
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,630
I don't know how long there is.

308
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:44,430
And I can't. I wasn't prepared for you.
For wanting something...

309
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,590
Next week it is.

310
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,790
I'm getting married.

311
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,750
Next week?

312
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,670
To nice Greg?

313
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,550
- Sure you're going through with that?
- I have to.

314
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,390
- You have to?
- Mm-hmm.

315
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,110
He really is a good guy.

316
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,270
I mean, my family don't approve, but...

317
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,510
they can't stop us.

318
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,110
I know he pities me. That pisses me off.

319
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,150
But that's not fair 'cause he's...

320
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,630
You said you don't know
how much time there is.

321
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,070
What does that mean?

322
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,550
They tell me three months.

323
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,430
It's spread basically everywhere.

324
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,950
They said three months before
six months ago.

325
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,950
So, you know, what do they know?

326
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,630
Doesn't even taste of anything.

327
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,190
- But so you'll stay here after?
- No.

328
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,990
When I'm done, I am done.

329
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,310
But that's cra... I mean...

330
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,630
- Why?
- Richard.

331
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,390
That's...

332
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,150
My husband's name was Richard.

333
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,710
He died just two years ago.

334
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,630
So we had the opportunity
to stay in San Junipero.

335
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,710
Pass over.

336
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,910
Didn't take it.

337
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,510
- Didn't want to take it.
- Why wouldn't anyone take it?

338
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,350
He had his viewpoint.

339
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:30,350
There were things he believed
and things he didn't believe in,

340
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,110
and this place was one of them.

341
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,950
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

342
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,270
Shit.

343
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,790
I didn't know if I wanted to try it
but... I mean...

344
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,710
Jesus, without this place,
I never would've met someone like you.

345
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,750
- Yeah, you could have.
- No, I wouldn't.

346
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,070
- We could have met outside all this.
- No.

347
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,510
You... would not have got me at all.

348
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,670
At all.

349
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,630
If we really met, I mean...

350
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:15,110
If we <i>really</i> met, you wouldn't like me.

351
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,030
Try me.

352
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,390
Or you'd...
You wouldn't want to spend time with me.

353
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,710
- You'd come and then...
- Try me.

354
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,790
Why?

355
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,390
Why? What's the point?

356
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,590
What? Where are you? Houston?

357
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,310
Carson City, Nevada.

358
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,430
So come on.

359
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,590
I showed you mine.

360
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,470
Where are you?

361
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,990
- I can just look it up.
- Santa Rosa, California.

362
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,790
- That's no distance.
- I don't want you to...

363
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,990
- I don't want you to see me. I'm scared...
- And I'm dying.

364
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,990
Whatever you are can't scare me.

365
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,310
Let me come visit.

366
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,870
I want to say hi.

367
00:38:37,423 --> 00:38:38,635
_

368
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,790
Here you go.

369
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,310
You okay?

370
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,590
<i>Please check in at our self-service pods</i>

371
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,470
<i>using swipe cards provided.</i>

372
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,230
- You must be Kelly.
- I guess I must.

373
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,550
- She's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

374
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,350
Please.

375
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,910
She won't be able
to physically respond in any way.

376
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,830
But she can hear you.

377
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,950
I'll give you some privacy.

378
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,270
Hello, stupid.

379
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,190
It's good to see you.

380
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:53,110
Uh... Hello. Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?

381
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,990
It is.

382
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,230
- I'm Greg.
- You're Greg?

383
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,630
Holy shit.

384
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,470
Yeah, I think it's great
that you came down here in person

385
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,830
before she passes over.

386
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,670
Even her folks
don't come visit no more so...

387
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,030
She's passing over?

388
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,990
- When?
- Uh...

389
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,430
- Let's go grab a coffee.
- Okay.

390
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,110
- She didn't tell you?
- No, she did not.

391
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:29,710
- Said she was just visiting.
- More like sampling the trial version.

392
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:37,430
I mean, I've only known her
the past three years.

393
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,470
We talk on the comm box.

394
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,190
She told you how she ended up
quadriplegic?

395
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,110
And how long she's been that way?

396
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:54,230
One night, she's 21,
comes out to her folks.

397
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,990
They're a little uptight about it,
you might say.

398
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,830
They told her they don't
want a gay daughter.

399
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,990
It's not natural and so forth.

400
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,110
They fight. She gets in her car.
Runs it off the road. Boom!

401
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,310
- When she was 21?
- More than 40 years back.

402
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,430
It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

403
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,030
So the whole San Junipero system
has been a big deal for her.

404
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,630
The biggest deal.

405
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:21,630
Of course now, until she passes over,
it goes permanent,

406
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,110
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

407
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,070
I guess you're the same.

408
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,630
They ration it out.
They don't trust us with more.

409
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,710
They say you go crazy
if you have too much, you know?

410
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,670
You don't leave your seat.
You disassociate body from mind.

411
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,790
Like that doesn't happen
in every senior home already.

412
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,110
The system's there
for therapeutic reasons,

413
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,150
immersive nostalgia therapy.

414
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,750
Plunge you into a world of memories.

415
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,830
Helps with Alzheimer's,
that's what they say.

416
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,150
Small mercies.

417
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,790
So...

418
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,830
About this marriage...

419
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,150
The state's got a triple lockdown
on euthanasia cases.

420
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:09,350
You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,
the patient, a family member.

421
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:13,830
It's to stop folks from passing over just
because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

422
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,750
Anyhow, Yorkie's family,

423
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,030
they're big-time religious,
and they will not sign.

424
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,350
But a spouse can override them.

425
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,550
- Hence the wedding bells.
- You got it.

426
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,670
We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,

427
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,590
and then she's scheduled to pass
tomorrow afternoon.

428
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,030
"Scheduled to pass."
Let's just call it dying.

429
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,110
If you can call it dying.

430
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,310
Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

431
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,470
I guess.

432
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,630
You gonna wear a suit?

433
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,910
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

434
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,790
I never married so I just figured,
you know, what's the harm?

435
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,190
You're a good man.

436
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,670
It's the least I could do, right?

437
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,510
Think you could hook us up
to the system now?

438
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:09,630
Just for a little while,
before she passes?

439
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,310
You can still see her afterwards.
I mean, then she's no limit.

440
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,230
She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan.

441
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,470
I know, but can you?

442
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,150
Seriously, it is so tight here
that they monitor every...

443
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,190
I only want a moment.

444
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,190
Ma'am.

445
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:46,270
- You got five minutes
- Thank you.

446
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,110
Hey!

447
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,470
I've never been here
during the daylight.

448
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,470
It's warm.

449
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:11,190
Listen, I gotta be quick.
So I spoke to Greg.

450
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,390
Oh.

451
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,550
- You're passing over tomorrow?
- Yeah.

452
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,350
Couple of hours after the wedding.

453
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:24,510
So I guess I am technically
honeymooning here forever.

454
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,230
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

455
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:34,350
- I'm gonna say something crazy.
- Okay.

456
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,150
Wanna marry me instead?

457
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:45,110
It's just... Greg seems great, but...

458
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,750
Why not someone you've connected with?

459
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,590
Is that a yes?

460
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,110
...to be your lawfully wedded wife,

461
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:09,350
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

462
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:15,230
in good times and in woe,
for richer, for poorer...

463
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:29,629
_

464
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:49,550
Hold tight.

465
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,190
There you go.

466
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,510
Nearly there.

467
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,750
That's it.

468
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,750
Are you sure you're all right?

469
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:45,830
Hey!

470
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,550
You didn't dress up to see me?

471
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,310
Oh...

472
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,830
Come on!

473
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,070
Better?

474
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:07,190
Whoop!

475
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:11,590
Oh!

476
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,750
Oh! Whoo!

477
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,470
Looks so real.

478
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,510
It feels so real!

479
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:42,270
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I love it here!

480
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,350
I just love it.

481
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:47,110
- You've been here before.
- But now I live here!

482
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:49,910
Be with me.

483
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:54,870
- I'm with you now.
- That's not what I mean.

484
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,150
Pass over.

485
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:02,430
- When it's your time.
- Yorkie.

486
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,870
- Stay here with me.
- Can we just enjoy tonight?

487
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,950
It's almost midnight.

488
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,390
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

489
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,110
Then I gotta wait a week
to see you again.

490
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:14,310
- You know I'm just a visitor.
- What, a couple of months, then what?

491
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,110
- We're not discussing this.
- Then you're gone.

492
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,030
- Just gone. You could have forever.
- Forever?

493
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:24,350
- Who can even make sense of forever?
- However long you want then.

494
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,030
I mean, you can remove yourself
like that.

495
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,910
It's not a trap.

496
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,390
I mean, look at it! Jesus! Touch it!

497
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,790
- I'm going.
- Hey! Oh. Hey.

498
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,670
It's real.

499
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,230
This is real.

500
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,470
And this.

501
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,510
- Hmm?
- Come on.

502
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,430
You know that was just a gesture.

503
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:55,110
- You married me.
- To help you pass over.

504
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:00,070
- As a... kindness.
- It's not so kind to leave.

505
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,110
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

506
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,910
I got this chance.

507
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,790
<i>We</i> got this chance.
I wanna share it with you.

508
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:20,830
I said I made my choice.

509
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:24,030
What is it? You feel bad
because your husband isn't here?

510
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,710
- Because that was his choice.
- Don't.

511
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:30,470
He chose not to stay here.
It's like he left you.

512
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,510
You know, he could have stayed,
but he chose to leave you.

513
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,870
- You don't know what you're saying.
- You should be mad at him.

514
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,990
- Not whipping yourself with guilt.
- Get off me.

515
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,950
You can't see it!
But what he did, it was selfish actually!

516
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,070
Forty-nine years...

517
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:56,510
I was with him for 49 years.

518
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,110
You can't begin to imagine.

519
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,830
You can't know...

520
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:08,230
the bond, the commitment, the boredom,

521
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,670
the yearning, the laughter,
the love of it.

522
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,310
The fucking love. You just cannot know!

523
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,430
Everything we sacrificed.

524
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,390
The years I gave him.
The years he gave me.

525
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,830
Did you think to ask?

526
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:28,390
Did it occur to you to ask?

527
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,350
We had a daughter.

528
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,310
Alison.

529
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:41,110
Always difficult, always beautiful.

530
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:43,910
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

531
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:47,070
And Richard and I,
we felt that heartbreak as one.

532
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:51,270
You think you're the only person
ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

533
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,550
- Well, I didn't know...
- Didn't think to.

534
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,630
You know, when he was dying,
Richard said to me

535
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:01,350
when they offered him this,
to pass over, pass through,

536
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,110
spend eternity in this fucking graveyard
you're so in love with,

537
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:09,870
he said, "How can I?
When she missed out, how can I?"

538
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,350
And so he went.

539
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,750
And I wish I could believe he's
with her now,

540
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,470
that they're together, but I don't.

541
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,390
I believe they're nowhere.
Just like you said.

542
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:27,070
Gone. No, I pitied you,
and that's the truth. I pitied you.

543
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,550
Now you give me some sales pitch

544
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,510
about how fucking peachy forever
could be.

545
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,630
I'm sorry.

546
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,910
You wanna spend forever
somewhere nothing matters?

547
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,790
End up like Wes?

548
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,990
All those lost fucks at the Quagmire

549
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:42,150
trying anything to feel something,
go ahead.

550
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:46,150
But I'm out. I'm gone.

551
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:53,110
Kelly, I'm sorry. Kelly!

552
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:25,592
_

553
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,150
Hey, Kelly.

554
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:14,150
- You all right?
- Yeah, I am fine.

555
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:13,990
- Well, okay then.
- Huh?

556
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:19,430
Kelly?

557
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,670
All things considered...

558
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,150
I guess I'm ready.

559
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,790
For what?

560
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:35,070
For the rest of it.

561
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:29,850
_

562
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,230
Ready?

563
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:52,230
Whoo!

564
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:59,430
Whoo!

565
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:14,590
