_

3
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,401
- Hey, Lacie!
- Hey!

4
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:05,921
Ryan?

5
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,865
Ryan!

6
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,881
- I was holding a bomb!
- Come on!

7
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,481
Sorry, guys.

8
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:26,241
Landlord is sending buyers over
today so... put your pants on.

9
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:30,601
Maybe if I don't, it'll scare 'em
off and we can stay here.

10
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:34,041
Not an option, Ryan.
Lease is up in four weeks.

11
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:36,105
Hey, I'm thinking of you.
I've got somewhere to go.

12
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,585
Nate's roommate took a job in
Phoenix so I get his place.

13
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:43,921
- Okay.
- Now who's the slow poke?

14
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:49,385
I'm... seeing some places
over lunch. Catch you later.

15
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,625
Sorry, that was my sister.

16
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,385
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you'd love to.

17
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:08,025
Jasmine tea?

18
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:21,505
And that's one Brushed Suede.

19
00:03:22,465 --> 00:03:24,201
You want a cookie with that?

20
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:27,825
- It's on the house.
- Sounds awesome.

21
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:36,001
- See you tomorrow, JJ.
- See you, Lacie.

22
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:41,567
Oh, I saw your boy in
the fire hat just now! So cute!

23
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,897
Yeah, he's really something.

24
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:31,665
Hmm.

25
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:10,361
Hey, Lacie!

26
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:13,801
- Bets, it's great to see you!
- You too.

27
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:26,641
How's Pancakes?

28
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:30,921
He's hilarious. Such a
funny cat. Just the best.

29
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:37,121
- Are you still at Hoddicker?
- Mm-hmm.

30
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:40,241
- Yeah. It's going pretty great.
- Good to hear.

31
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:42,481
- So what brings you back here?
- New job, first day.

32
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:45,001
- First day?
- At Blankman-Harper.

33
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:47,921
Whoa! Top floor! That's...

34
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:51,305
- Well, good luck.
- I know, right?

35
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:55,761
It's great you're still
happy at Hoddicker.

36
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:58,081
- Well, maybe not forever.
- No, not forever.

37
00:05:58,105 --> 00:05:59,801
- But for now...
- It's OK for now.

38
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:03,385
It's great for now, yes. Yes, it is.

39
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:03,401
Lacie, I got you a smoothie.

40
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:07,185
Got one for everyone, actually.
Still a bunch of them for grabs.

41
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:11,121
They're from the organic
stall at the farmers' market.

42
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:12,625
Sure. Okay.

43
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,945
Mmm!

44
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:29,385
Thank you. Thank you.

45
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:36,105
We're kind
of not talking to Ches.

46
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:41,281
- 3.1? What happened?
- Him and Gordon split up.

47
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:42,801
Oh...

48
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:45,761
- Poor Ches.
- No, no, no, we're all on Gordon's side.

49
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:48,521
Sure! Obviously.

50
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:52,121
Ches is kissing ass.
Trying to scrape himself back.

51
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:56,601
Of course, if it drops below two-five,
then it's... bye-bye.

52
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,040
_

53
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,921
Hello?

54
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:31,921
- Yo, they're taking it.
- Who?

55
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:35,241
The couple the landlord sent over.
I heard them talking.

56
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,305
Okay.

57
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:43,401
So, now we move into
the light space area.

58
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:47,361
Ideal for special times with loved ones.

59
00:08:47,385 --> 00:08:51,345
- Great food, great company.
- Mm-hmm!

60
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:56,561
Whoa!

61
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:59,065
Sampled your
photo stream to make her.

62
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:01,681
Great hair!

63
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:04,127
Styled free of charge
at the members' salon.

64
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:07,705
Oh, my God.

65
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:11,001
It's hilarious!

66
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,721
You like him?

67
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,841
- He's okay.
- He doesn't come with the apartment.

68
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:24,161
But there is a bar and restaurant
on site, tenants only.

69
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:28,361
We have unparalleled
metrics on romantic geneses.

70
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:29,481
Uh-huh.

71
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:33,227
I gotta say,
these places are going like "that."

72
00:09:33,252 --> 00:09:37,466
- So don't delay if you're interested.
- Oh, I'm more than interested.

73
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,346
Standard occupancy on a
minimum six-month contract,

74
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,810
we're talking... this much.

75
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,090
- How often are the payments?
- That's weekly.

76
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,506
Okay.

77
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,506
- A little more than expected?
- Yeah.

78
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:55,226
There's options.

79
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,706
You know our Prime Influencers Programme?

80
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,450
- Do I qualify for that?
- No. No, you don't.

81
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,650
We'd need you around a 4.5.

82
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:07,706
4.5?

83
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,890
Hit 4.5 and there's a 20% discount.

84
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,810
- 4.5.
- That's right.

85
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,746
Pelican Cove? What is this?
A eugenics programme?

86
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,746
- A lifestyle community.
- No one is this happy.

87
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,266
A two-year-old with a fucking
balloon isn't this happy.

88
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,227
It's actually a pretty cool place.

89
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,090
Like you'd even qualify.

90
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,306
There's nothing I can do, sir.

91
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,826
Well, it's not hopeless,
you're clearly a tryer.

92
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,386
That's the sense you get just from... me?

93
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,066
From your rep report analytics.

94
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,706
If we drill down into the numbers,
you've got a solid popularity arc here.

95
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,210
Strong overall trajectory.
Let's just look at the last 24 hours.

96
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,940
You see, even...

97
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,506
What's that? 8:40 a.m. You're
working hard on your socials.

98
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,546
- Great little uptake there.
- Okay.

99
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,906
Couple of minor dings there.
You cut someone off in traffic?

100
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,826
Oh, just a workplace thing.

101
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,866
Okay. Let's check on
your sphere of influence.

102
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,930
Let me zoom out here.

103
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:19,266
Great peripherals.
Strangers like you, that's a plus.

104
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,586
- Healthy inner circle. It's good.
- Thank you.

105
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:27,490
There's a ways to go,
but 4.5 is certainly achievable.

106
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:29,403
How long do you think?

107
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,603
- To hit 4.5?
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:32,683
Well, barring a major setback,

109
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:36,867
a public disgrace kind of deal,
I'd say 18 months or so.

110
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:42,403
Oh, I need more short term.
Like... much more.

111
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:43,707
Then you'll need a boost.

112
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,787
- What kind of a boost?
- Well...

113
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,083
Most of your interactions are
confined to your inner circle

114
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:55,603
and they're largely, pardon the term,
mid-to low-range folks.

115
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:57,043
Same with your outer circle.

116
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,323
You've got a ton of reciprocal five
stars from service industry workers,

117
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,283
but there's not much else.

118
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:03,626
At least as far as I can see.

119
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:06,923
So in terms of quality,
you could use a punch up right there.

120
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:10,107
Ideally, that's up votes
from quality people.

121
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,643
- Quality people?
- High fours.

122
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,283
Impress those up-scale folks,
you'll gain velocity on your arc

123
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:18,947
and there's your boost.

124
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:36,507
- Oh, hi, JJ!
- Hey, Lacie!

125
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,667
- Keith! Hello.
- Lacie!

126
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:41,867
- You look great today.
- Thank you!

127
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:47,064
- Door won't open. I'm on 2.4.
- Sorry, Ches. I'm late.

128
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,009
I just need some stars, please!

129
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:51,987
Fuck!

130
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:03,243
- Oh, hi!
- Hi!

131
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:06,603
- How's it going at Blankman?
- Just great.

132
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:11,827
- Well, I bet you work... good there.
- Thank you.

133
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:18,203
Would you like a croissant?

134
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:20,403
They gave me an extra
at the coffee place.

135
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:23,603
- Oh, no, I already ate.
- Okay, sure. All good. Yes.

136
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:24,867
Yeah.

137
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:31,563
Well, here's me, so...

138
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:42,083
Don't try too hard.
It's impossible to respect.

139
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:46,603
High fours can smell it
a mile off. Just be you.

140
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:48,923
Authentic gestures, that's the key.

141
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:52,387
- That's time up, I'll catch you later.
- Oh, could I just ask...

142
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:59,867
... "Mr. Rags."

143
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,151
_

144
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:04,602
_

145
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,232
Shit!

146
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:53,803
- What the fuck is that?
- Tapenade. Want some?

147
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:55,563
Who even are you?

148
00:16:55,587 --> 00:16:58,123
It's just something I wanna eat, Ryan.

149
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:03,947
Oh, my God.

150
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,107
- What is it?
- Naomi!

151
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:08,907
Shit!

152
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:14,187
Old school, el perfecto Naomi?
You guys keep in contact?

153
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:17,307
Ryan, just go! Go!

154
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:27,163
- Oh, my God!
- Nay-Nay, how are you?

155
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:29,563
I was just fixing myself a snack.

156
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:34,483
Oh, Lace, could I just say I
am so happy to see your face?

157
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:37,323
- Me too. It's been...
- Too long.

158
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,314
- Way too long.
- And that's my fault.

159
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:42,203
- No, it's mine. Everything is just so...
- Everything's just so...

160
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,563
Crazy! Oh, it's so good to see you.

161
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:49,123
When you posted that
Mr. Rags photo...

162
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:51,123
I know, Mr. Rags!

163
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:53,123
I just had to call

164
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:56,443
and talk to you because...

165
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,443
Whoo-hoo!

166
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:02,922
Wow! That's a... big ring!

167
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:07,683
Congratulations! Who's the, um... Paul?

168
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:11,283
He is great. So smart. Just sweet.

169
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,123
I know you're gonna love him.

170
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:14,283
Uh-huh.

171
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:16,043
So, anyways, the big day...

172
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:17,283
Yes, when is it?

173
00:18:17,307 --> 00:18:18,803
So, we're getting married in a month

174
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:19,963
on his family's estate

175
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,243
up here on the island.

176
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,043
This place outside Port Mary,
Honeysuckle. You heard of it?

177
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,123
No, but...

178
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,043
Well, it's a private island.

179
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:31,363
Take a looooook!

180
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:33,643
Oh, wow! That is...

181
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:38,123
I know, right? So... can you make it?

182
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:40,587
Are you kidding? Of course.

183
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:43,547
Great, cool,
cos I was wondering if...

184
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:47,067
Lace, do you think...

185
00:18:48,187 --> 00:18:49,587
Would you be my maid of honour?

186
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,574
Seriously?

187
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,323
Oh, my God.

188
00:18:57,003 --> 00:19:01,163
I mean, you've got such cool
friends now. Are you sure?

189
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:05,923
Remember when we used to plan our
dream weddings when we were, like, 11?

190
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:10,562
- I know but we haven't s...
- I don't know, just seeing Mr. Rags...

191
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:14,283
All the memories.
It just brought things home.

192
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:15,443
Oh, Nay-Nay.

193
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,802
I know we haven't kept in touch
as much as I'd have liked

194
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:20,963
and that is totally my fault,
but this is a big day.

195
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:26,683
A big life day and I want my oldest
friend with me, my oldest friend.

196
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,467
I want you by my side.

197
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:33,067
Oh, my God. Thank you.

198
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:36,043
What do I have to...

199
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,403
Not much to it. A speech, mainly.

200
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,523
Speech? Of course!

201
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:43,283
Mm-hmm. How big's the crowd?

202
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,803
- Oh, my gosh, like...
- hundreds!

203
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:49,403
It's a crazy guest list. I'll send it now.

204
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:52,403
Paul's invited so many,
I don't want to call them big deals,

205
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:54,813
but they're all, like, 4.7 or above.

206
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:57,827
Uh-huh.

207
00:19:59,187 --> 00:20:03,163
Nay-Nay, I will not
let you down.

208
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:07,323
Don't sweat too much!
Just talk about old memories.

209
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:09,923
- Sure.
- How we were, any old things.

210
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:12,003
- Gotcha.
- I'll ping you some anecdotes.

211
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,243
- That would be great.
- And what's your dress size?

212
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:15,483
Oh, um...

213
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,643
I'll tell you what,
I'll just send you a four.

214
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,003
- Perfect.
- We got matching bridesmaids dresses.

215
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:21,883
Well, anyway...

216
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,218
Love you, Lay.

217
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:30,963
You too, Nay-Nay!

218
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:31,787
Oh!

219
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,603
Bye.

220
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:42,507
What was that? The F-word?

221
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:45,787
You two pussy pals now?

222
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:47,803
Shut up.

223
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:51,163
- She was always mean to you.
- No, she wasn't.

224
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:54,923
- She had that rhyme about you.
- That was a game.

225
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:58,363
- What about when she cut your hair?
- I asked her to.

226
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,003
She fucked Greg.

227
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:04,987
She... did not fuck Greg.

228
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,867
She looked hot. I'll give her that.

229
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:20,094
Okay.

230
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,587
Impressive.

231
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:31,043
- Uh-huh. Jesus. Yeah, that'd do it.
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:33,843
Pelican Cove.

233
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:38,043
Carole, it's Lacie. Saw the
place yesterday. I wanna take it.

234
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,883
That's fantastic!

235
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:43,843
Uh... Oh, I see you're still
on a 4.2. Is that, um...

236
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:47,763
Yep, I'm on it, just gonna
transfer the deposit now.

237
00:21:47,787 --> 00:21:49,469
- Well, okay.
- Yes!

238
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:55,467
In this world, we're all so
caught up in our own heads.

239
00:21:57,147 --> 00:22:02,547
It's easy to lose sight of
what's real. What matters.

240
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:07,067
But as I stand here today...

241
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:13,427
seeing the joy Paul has
brought to Naomi's life,

242
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:19,147
I know she's someone
who truly matters to me.

243
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:23,347
Nay-Nay,

244
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:29,643
the little girl who, when we were
just five-years-old in art camp,

245
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:34,867
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

246
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:42,827
The girl who helped me make
Mr. Rags. I still have him.

247
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:46,067
He sits on my desk and...

248
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:50,787
every day, he reminds me of Nay-Nay.

249
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:56,547
What she meant to me then and now.

250
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:01,747
I am so honored to be here

251
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:08,907
and I wish you all the happiness
this stupid world can muster.

252
00:23:11,627 --> 00:23:13,827
I love you, Nay-Nay.

253
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,107
Is the tear too much?

254
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:21,083
You fucking sociopath.

255
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:26,163
- Ryan, my car's here. Was it too much?
- What, the tear, the photo, Mr. Rags?

256
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,123
I do keep him on my desk.

257
00:23:28,147 --> 00:23:31,043
There's sugary and then
there's fucking diabetes.

258
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,923
I just wanna make her
happy on her wedding day.

259
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:36,923
The captive audience of 4-point
holies five-starring your ass off,

260
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:38,083
that's just a bonus.

261
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:41,443
- Naomi and I were best friends.
- Come on...

262
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:44,403
I wish her well and wanna
express it the best I can.

263
00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:46,923
And, yeah, if I nail a speech
and get five-starred

264
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:49,403
by hundreds of primes, so what?
It's a win-win.

265
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:53,688
What are you hoping for? Like, 4.3, 4.4?

266
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:56,769
Unh-unh. You get points
from your gaming buddies.

267
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:59,449
It's the same thing.
Don't shit on me for aiming higher.

268
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:00,769
Pelican Cove higher?

269
00:24:00,793 --> 00:24:03,689
What's wrong with Pelican Cove?
They're great apartments!

270
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:06,689
They are fake-smile jail cells.

271
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,753
Great. Car cancelled.

272
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:12,232
And he marked me down so now I have
to book another, and I took a ding.

273
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:16,003
- Great job.
- I am sorry, but I miss the normal you.

274
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:20,123
Before this obsession, when we
had conversations, remember?

275
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:21,203
I need my charger.

276
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:25,723
This whole ranking thing, just
comparing yourself to people who...

277
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:28,963
- Have you seen my charger?
- ...only pretend to be happy.

278
00:24:28,987 --> 00:24:31,747
I said don't borrow this!

279
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:36,003
High fours like Naomi,
I bet they're suicidal on the inside.

280
00:24:36,027 --> 00:24:37,723
My car is here. Again.

281
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:39,923
Your Pelican Cove deposit,
is it refundable?

282
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:41,403
Like, what if this doesn't work?

283
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:44,443
- Can't you just stay out of my shit?
- You're my sister!

284
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:47,283
Yes! And if you cared about that,
maybe you would've noticed

285
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:51,227
living with you hasn't been one
big rainbow sandwich for me.

286
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:54,963
Do you know why I never
brought any guys back here?

287
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:58,523
Because I didn't want them to know
I was sharing a skanky-ass cave

288
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:01,587
with Mr. Three Point Fuck.

289
00:25:03,347 --> 00:25:05,027
Good luck with your performance!

290
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:41,067
Oh, hi, hi! I'm coming. I'm coming.

291
00:25:42,227 --> 00:25:44,603
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

292
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,667
That's great. Just great.

293
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:54,747
Oh... Hi.

294
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:07,963
Nay-Nay!

295
00:26:07,987 --> 00:26:10,083
Hey, Lace! Just checking in.

296
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:13,283
I'm on my way to the
airport right now.

297
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:15,643
Okay, cool, and you're all
good for the rehearsal dinner?

298
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:20,523
Oh, yeah. The flight's, what, an hour?
That restaurant looks so cool.

299
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:24,443
- Uh-huh. And you got the dress okay?
- Mm-hmm. In my case.

300
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:25,803
- I love the pink.
- Uh-huh.

301
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:29,883
So the latest draft of
the speech is great.

302
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:31,923
Going handwritten's so cool.

303
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:35,563
Those scans of the page, my God,
I welled up just at that.

304
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:39,107
- Oh, thank you!
- Um... just one thought.

305
00:26:39,707 --> 00:26:42,243
That whole bit where I help you
with the eating disorder thing...

306
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,483
- You think that's a little...
- A little over-sharing, yeah.

307
00:26:44,507 --> 00:26:46,523
You're so right. It's gone.

308
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:49,483
Okay. Cool. Well, I'll
see you in a few hours!

309
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,443
♪ I'm getting married tomorrow ♪

310
00:27:04,627 --> 00:27:08,312
- And here's your tip.
- Thank you.

311
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:13,227
Oh, come on.

312
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:16,707
May I
have your attention, please...

313
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:27,629
- Hi there, how are you doing?
- I am wonderful.

314
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:33,467
I am so sorry, that flight is cancelled.

315
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:37,907
- No. No, no, no.
- Customer incident at the other end.

316
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:41,363
But... So when is the next flight?

317
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:44,443
Yeah, they're all kind of full.

318
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:48,123
Uh... I booked this weeks ago.
It's my best friend's wedding.

319
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:50,283
- I'm sorry.
- I have to get there. I have to.

320
00:27:50,307 --> 00:27:52,203
Okay... let's see what we can do.

321
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:54,267
Thank you. Thank you so much.

322
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,923
I see there's one standby seat
on another plane leaving tonight.

323
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:05,547
Uh...

324
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:09,203
That's reserved for members
of our Prime Flight Programme.

325
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:11,203
You gotta be a 4.2 or over to qualify.

326
00:28:11,227 --> 00:28:13,563
- Oh, I'm... I'm a 4.2.
- Uh-huh.

327
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:16,918
I'm afraid you're actually a 4.183.

328
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:23,003
Oh. Well, that's not my fault. Um...

329
00:28:23,027 --> 00:28:25,643
Some woman dinged me
down in the... Can't you just...

330
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:28,163
I'm sorry, it won't let me book
it without the correct ranking.

331
00:28:28,187 --> 00:28:30,283
- But it's so close.
- There's just nothing I can do.

332
00:28:30,307 --> 00:28:32,043
- Christ, I mean, surely.
- I'm gonna have to ask you

333
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:34,123
to moderate your language there.

334
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:35,467
Sorry. It's just...

335
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:41,483
I'm maid of honour.
I cannot miss this wedding.

336
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:44,427
And I am so sorry about that.

337
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:49,323
- Can you call the supervisor?
- I cannot do that.

338
00:28:49,347 --> 00:28:50,963
- Can you just call the supervisor?
- I cannot do that.

339
00:28:50,987 --> 00:28:52,883
- Call the fucking supervisor!
- Okay, that's profanity.

340
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:55,563
- We're zero tolerance on profanity.
- I'm sorry. It's just...

341
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:57,883
- I have to serve the next customer.
- No, no, no, no.

342
00:28:57,907 --> 00:29:01,083
- Can you step away, ma'am?
- God, just fucking help me!

343
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:02,163
Ooh.

344
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:05,507
I'm so sorry.

345
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:10,643
- I've called security.
- Oh, no, no, no. Please don't do that.

346
00:29:10,668 --> 00:29:13,983
I'm, uh... five-starring you. Five stars.

347
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:16,203
- What's the issue here, Hannah?
- Intimidation and profanity.

348
00:29:16,227 --> 00:29:18,603
- Oh, no, no. I was not intimidating.
- Don't speak, ma'am.

349
00:29:18,627 --> 00:29:20,347
- I was just trying to...
- Ma'am.

350
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:25,003
Okay. So, in order to restore calm,

351
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:27,323
I'm invoking my authority
as airport security

352
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:30,323
to dock you one full ranking
point as a punitive measure.

353
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:32,243
- This is a temporary measure.
- No!

354
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:33,995
Your score reverts
to normal in 24 hours.

355
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,963
No, no, no. But I need it now.

356
00:29:34,987 --> 00:29:38,483
During this period, all down votes
are subject to a times two multiplier.

357
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:39,603
Times two?

358
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:41,683
We recommend you avoid
negative feedback at this time.

359
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:42,763
I'm on double damage?

360
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:46,961
Please, remove yourself
from the airport immediately.

361
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:11,203
Okay, well, due to your ranking...

362
00:30:33,107 --> 00:30:36,083
Hi there. Chuck! Great name.

363
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:38,923
- Thank you.
- Hope you're having a great night.

364
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:41,683
- It's pretty good.
- So I need a car.

365
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,843
- You got a vehicle in mind?
- Anything, really.

366
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:47,563
Well, due to your current ranking,

367
00:30:47,587 --> 00:30:50,403
you're restricted to
our super saver fleet.

368
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:53,363
- Yep. That's... Yeah.
- I-Cruiser 2?

369
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:55,387
They still have the 2?

370
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:22,563
Oh, God.

371
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:42,163
Oh, come on.

372
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:43,963
Uh...

373
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:50,867
Damn it!

374
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:16,867
The little girl, who when we were
both five years old in art camp,

375
00:32:16,987 --> 00:32:20,907
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

376
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:25,787
The girl who helped me make Mr. Rags...

377
00:32:28,587 --> 00:32:33,483
Teardrop. Crowd goes wild. You can do this.

378
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:43,267
- Sorry, okay, I swear I'm on my way.
- How far away are you?

379
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:47,843
Uh... Quite a ways. I missed my flight.

380
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:50,443
- What?
- Well, not missed it but...

381
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,307
So you're not gonna make
the rehearsal dinner?

382
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,723
- No.
- Lacie!

383
00:32:54,747 --> 00:32:57,587
I am so sorry. It's been...

384
00:32:58,107 --> 00:33:00,603
I got a rental car. I'm driving.

385
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:04,523
Driving? That's like nine hours.

386
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:05,923
I'm making good time,

387
00:33:05,947 --> 00:33:09,443
gonna go through the night,
make a road trip out of it.

388
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:10,827
Is everything okay?

389
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:13,643
I can find a replacement
if something's wrong.

390
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:16,643
No. No. No. I'll be there.
I swear on Mr. Rags.

391
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,123
Ha ha ha!

392
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:20,243
Okay, just drive safe!

393
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:21,923
You bet. I'll just...

394
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:32,387
Come on.

395
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:35,963
Come on.

396
00:33:35,987 --> 00:33:37,267
Please.

397
00:33:43,907 --> 00:33:44,987
Okay.

398
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:15,363
What do you want?

399
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:24,027
Oh, shit.

400
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:58,147
Hi. Sorry.

401
00:35:02,827 --> 00:35:04,987
Your charger doesn't fit my car.

402
00:35:07,387 --> 00:35:10,627
- Don't see those around much these days.
- It's a rental.

403
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:16,667
Ours chargers are Q2Z, yours one's a K1.
They didn't give you an adapter?

404
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:20,427
No. Do you have one?

405
00:35:22,382 --> 00:35:26,243
- Not in here. Ask around.
- Thanks, anyway.

406
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:28,307
You're super helpful.

407
00:35:40,867 --> 00:35:42,107
Two stars?!

408
00:35:43,147 --> 00:35:44,443
Two stars?

409
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,587
Wasn't a meaningful encounter.

410
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:52,083
Sir, excuse me.

411
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:53,843
Excuse me, sorry.

412
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:57,547
Do you have a K1 adapter, by any chance?

413
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:03,267
Ma'am, how about you, a K1 adapter,
perhaps, in the trunk of your car?

414
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:05,696
Sure.

415
00:36:07,187 --> 00:36:08,267
Great.

416
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:12,987
Oh, ma'am, hi. Do you have a K1 adapter?

417
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,307
I have a rental car. It's...

418
00:37:01,707 --> 00:37:06,107
- Slow down. Let's give her a ride.
- She's, like, 2.8.

419
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,307
Come on!

420
00:37:16,427 --> 00:37:18,147
I didn't even do anything!

421
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:40,547
You look like you need a ride.

422
00:37:41,787 --> 00:37:43,403
Um...

423
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,227
Actually, I'm okay.

424
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:53,867
Don't look it. Come on. I don't bite.

425
00:37:56,747 --> 00:38:01,243
Luther, Mrs. Coffee, reds,
whiskey. Help yourself.

426
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,107
I'm okay. Thanks.

427
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:05,603
Where are you headed?

428
00:38:05,627 --> 00:38:10,427
Uh... Just as close as you can get
to Port Mary would be great.

429
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:21,947
Checking my feed for danger signs?

430
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:29,027
I get it a lot. 1.4 gotta be
an antisocial maniac, right?

431
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:32,363
- You seem...
- Normal?

432
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:34,587
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

433
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:40,667
It took some effort.
What happened to you?

434
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:45,483
I mean, you're a 2.8,
but you don't look 2.8.

435
00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:47,163
That's not... This is temporary.

436
00:38:47,187 --> 00:38:49,363
- I'm gonna turn it around.
- Uh-huh.

437
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:52,603
- I'm going to a wedding. Maid of honour.
- Nice.

438
00:38:52,627 --> 00:38:54,187
Wanna hear my speech?

439
00:38:55,027 --> 00:38:55,987
No.

440
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:02,043
So how come you're a 2.8?

441
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:05,563
Well, I got marked down
at the airport for yelling,

442
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:08,243
and they put me on double damage.

443
00:39:08,267 --> 00:39:11,427
- How did it feel?
- Awful.

444
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:13,747
I meant the yelling.

445
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:17,667
I don't know. I was mad.

446
00:39:18,547 --> 00:39:20,747
Look at where it got me.

447
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:25,963
But as long as I get to the
wedding, do the speech,

448
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:28,443
they'll overlook the
2.8. I'm with the bride.

449
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,523
And if I do well, well,
they're all high fours

450
00:39:30,547 --> 00:39:31,803
so that velocitates my arc.

451
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,483
And once they lift the point penalty,
well, my average goes way up,

452
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,067
and, yeah, it's gonna be okay.

453
00:39:41,307 --> 00:39:43,403
God, you remind me of me.

454
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:45,867
- Hmm.
- Not now.

455
00:39:47,747 --> 00:39:51,427
I was, uh... 4.6 once.

456
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:56,227
- 4.6?
- Used to live for it.

457
00:39:57,507 --> 00:39:59,827
All the work I put in...

458
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:06,043
Eight years ago, Tom,
my husband, got cancer.

459
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:11,307
It was pancreatic. It was a real bitch.
The symptoms showed up late.

460
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:13,867
I'm so sorry.

461
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,363
You don't know me so
you're not really sorry.

462
00:40:17,387 --> 00:40:21,627
You're just mainly awkward cos I
have sprung some cancer talk at you.

463
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:25,243
Anyway, I five-starred every doctor,

464
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:29,883
every nurse, every high-four
consultant that we had.

465
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:31,723
Ding. Ding. Ding. Thank you so much.

466
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:34,467
The cancer didn't give a shit.
It just kept growing.

467
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:39,643
A couple of months in, we heard
about this experimental treatment.

468
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:43,347
It was very expensive.
It was very exclusive.

469
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:48,347
I did everything I could
to get him a spot there.

470
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:52,827
Tom was a 4.3.

471
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:57,307
They gave his bed to a 4.4.

472
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:06,467
So when he died I thought, fuck it.

473
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:10,923
I started saying what I wanted,
when I wanted.

474
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:12,427
Just drop it out there.

475
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:14,987
People don't always like that.

476
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:19,323
It is incredible how fast
you slip off the ladder

477
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:21,083
when you start doing that.

478
00:41:21,107 --> 00:41:25,627
It turned out a lot of my
friends didn't care for honesty.

479
00:41:27,707 --> 00:41:32,003
Treated me like I had taken a
shit at their breakfast table.

480
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:36,083
But, Jesus Christ, it felt good.

481
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:38,587
Shedding those fuckers.

482
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:42,347
It was like taking off tight shoes.

483
00:41:42,827 --> 00:41:46,083
- Maybe you should try it?
- Oh, come on.

484
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,443
Why not?

485
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:52,163
I can't just kick off my shoes
and walk the earth or whatever.

486
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:55,547
- You won't know unless you try.
- Oh, that's just...

487
00:41:57,907 --> 00:42:00,923
Look, you had something with your life,

488
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:06,683
real things, good things,
and you lost it all, and I'm sorry.

489
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:11,323
So now you've got nothing left to lose.

490
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:14,243
But I don't even have the
something worth losing, not yet.

491
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:17,707
You know, I mean,
I'm still fighting for that.

492
00:42:19,547 --> 00:42:24,907
- And what is "that"?
- I don't know. Enough to be content?

493
00:42:25,987 --> 00:42:31,267
Like, to look around and think,
well, I guess I'm okay.

494
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:36,867
Just to be able to breathe out,
not feeling like... like...

495
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:44,283
Like just... And that is
way off, like, way, way off.

496
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:47,147
And until I get there, I have
to play the numbers game.

497
00:42:47,787 --> 00:42:51,947
We all do, that's what we're in.
That's how the fucking world works.

498
00:42:53,507 --> 00:42:57,987
Look, maybe you don't remember,
you know, you're just too old to get it.

499
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:02,067
I do not mean that how it sounds.

500
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:07,107
Don't worry. I'm not voting you down.

501
00:43:31,827 --> 00:43:35,283
- Sweetheart.
- What time is it?

502
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:39,603
I'm heading east from here so I think
you need to get yourself another ride.

503
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:42,763
- Where are we?
- About 30 miles from Port Mary.

504
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,083
A lot of buses stop here
so you should be fine.

505
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:49,403
- Well, thank you.
- Good luck with your speech.

506
00:43:51,947 --> 00:43:54,803
I put a little something in there for you.

507
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:58,383
- You did?
- Emergency escape hatch!

508
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:02,587
Bye.

509
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:20,683
In this world,
we're all so caught up...

510
00:44:20,707 --> 00:44:22,923
...in our own dramas.

511
00:44:22,947 --> 00:44:26,163
- So, Dad was like...
- It's easy to forget what matters.

512
00:44:26,187 --> 00:44:27,762
He'd never even heard of the show.

513
00:44:27,786 --> 00:44:29,803
I'm like, "You never heard of
Sea of Tranquillity?"

514
00:44:29,827 --> 00:44:32,523
Like, the number-one sci-fi fantasy,

515
00:44:32,547 --> 00:44:34,523
and he's all like,
"What the fuck?" Whatever!

516
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,763
I think I'm allergic to this purple.

517
00:44:36,787 --> 00:44:40,083
So I'm like, "Well, I'm going
to Tranquillity Con in Port Mary.

518
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:42,763
That's why I'm dressed
like Lieutenant Duster."

519
00:44:42,787 --> 00:44:45,683
He's all like, "Uh...
Port Mary is frickin' miles away."

520
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:46,803
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

521
00:44:46,827 --> 00:44:51,683
He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad.

522
00:44:51,707 --> 00:44:55,107
- See you back on there.
- Okay.

523
00:44:58,787 --> 00:45:02,763
Are you guys headed to Tranquillity Con?

524
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:05,803
- You're into Sea of Tranquillity?
- Totally.

525
00:45:05,827 --> 00:45:07,403
I was all set to go.

526
00:45:07,427 --> 00:45:13,147
My friend, who is there already,
has my costume, but my car broke down.

527
00:45:13,827 --> 00:45:16,507
Well, there's some space in the RV.

528
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:27,523
- Hi.
- Hey!

529
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:29,683
- You're a Trank head, huh?
- Sorry?

530
00:45:29,707 --> 00:45:32,003
Trank head. Sea of Tranquillity fan?

531
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:35,643
Oh, yeah. We say Tranksters where I'm from.

532
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:39,283
- Who's your favourite character?
- Gotta be Lieutenant Duster.

533
00:45:39,307 --> 00:45:41,123
- She's awesome.
- She?

534
00:45:41,147 --> 00:45:43,403
He! I misspoke.

535
00:45:43,427 --> 00:45:46,163
Lieutenant Duster has no fixed gender.

536
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:49,763
I know, and that's why it's
so hard to remember, right?

537
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:51,803
Excuse me. Gotta get this.

538
00:45:51,827 --> 00:45:54,507
My friend, at the convention.

539
00:45:56,747 --> 00:45:58,643
Hi, Nay!

540
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:04,003
So, oh, my God, insane night,
but I am so close now.

541
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,603
Don't come.

542
00:46:05,627 --> 00:46:09,203
What? No. No. I'm, like, an hour away.

543
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:11,243
Don't come. I don't want you here.

544
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:14,843
I don't know what is up with you,
but I cannot have a 2.6 at my wedding.

545
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:18,203
Oh, no, that's temporary!
That's temporary.

546
00:46:18,227 --> 00:46:20,523
Well, the wedding's today so...

547
00:46:20,547 --> 00:46:23,083
- But it doesn't change anything.
- Lacie...

548
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:25,283
- I can still do the same speech.
- Lacie...

549
00:46:25,307 --> 00:46:28,603
- And there's Mr. Rags!
- No!

550
00:46:28,627 --> 00:46:31,283
But... But you invited me.

551
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:33,963
You've seen the guest list.
They are all, like, 4.5 or above.

552
00:46:33,987 --> 00:46:37,403
They are going to freak at a 2.6,
and I am not taking that kind of damage,

553
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,067
plus I haven't dipped under
a 4.7 in, like, six months.

554
00:46:41,627 --> 00:46:45,123
You said you wanted your oldest friend.

555
00:46:45,147 --> 00:46:48,283
When I asked you to speak,
you were a 4.2, okay?

556
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:51,683
And the authenticity of a vintage bond
low four at a gathering of this calibre

557
00:46:51,707 --> 00:46:54,723
played fantastically on all
the stimulations we ran.

558
00:46:54,747 --> 00:46:57,003
Forecast was a prestige
bounce of 2 minimum.

559
00:46:57,027 --> 00:47:00,603
But now you're a sub three. Sorry.

560
00:47:00,627 --> 00:47:02,323
That just puts the stink on
things a little too much.

561
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:04,523
That just plays badly for us.

562
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:07,003
So it was just about numbers for you?

563
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:10,163
Oh, cut the shit! It was
numbers for both of us.

564
00:47:10,187 --> 00:47:12,123
You wanted those
primo votes, don't deny it.

565
00:47:12,147 --> 00:47:15,203
It's not like you could get them on
your own. Let's not kid ourselves.

566
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:17,643
Oh, I'm... I'm getting those votes.

567
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:21,003
What? You're just gonna roll up
here and make people like you?

568
00:47:21,027 --> 00:47:25,683
- That's right. I'm doing my speech.
- No, you're not.

569
00:47:25,707 --> 00:47:30,123
Yes, I am. And they are gonna vote me
through the roof when they hear it.

570
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:35,203
- Weep their fucking eyes out!
- Go home!

571
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,243
Hello?

572
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:40,827
Fuck!

573
00:47:43,547 --> 00:47:46,667
I have never seen
your stupid fucking show.

574
00:47:52,427 --> 00:47:55,067
Hope they cancel it!

575
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:08,667
I need a ride!

576
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:13,907
Fuck!

577
00:48:17,547 --> 00:48:19,027
Jesus!

578
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:37,107
Hey! Hey!

579
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:38,747
Hey!

580
00:48:40,707 --> 00:48:43,163
- Can I borrow your bike?
- What?

581
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:46,363
Can I borrow your bike?

582
00:48:46,387 --> 00:48:51,363
Do you, Naomi Jayne Blestow,
take this man to be your husband,

583
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:54,307
to live together with him
in the covenant of marriage?

584
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:57,323
To love him, comfort him,

585
00:48:57,347 --> 00:49:01,003
honour and keep him,
in sickness and in health...

586
00:49:01,027 --> 00:49:04,427
and forsaking all others,
be faithful unto him...

587
00:50:09,227 --> 00:50:12,323
To my best mate, Anthony.
Let's hear it for him.

588
00:50:13,947 --> 00:50:17,403
You've been there from day one.
I love you, man. I appreciate you.

589
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:20,963
Hilarious speech, by the way.
By your standards.

590
00:50:22,307 --> 00:50:25,203
- Pow! Pow! Pow!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

591
00:50:25,227 --> 00:50:28,883
He's still got a few
bullets left. Oh, man.

592
00:50:28,907 --> 00:50:30,947
Oh, gosh, well, um...

593
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:35,107
Shit!

594
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:39,643
We have so many people to
thank. Our beautiful bridesmaids.

595
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,523
But, of course,

596
00:50:41,547 --> 00:50:46,603
my most heartfelt thanks,
my warmest thanks,

597
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,907
are to someone who's my best friend,

598
00:50:51,187 --> 00:50:58,083
my lover and now,
I'm honoured to say, my wife.

599
00:50:58,107 --> 00:51:00,627
Naomi!

600
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:07,947
One, two, three! Naomi!

601
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:12,283
The A Team!

602
00:51:12,307 --> 00:51:13,723
I love you so much, darl.

603
00:51:13,747 --> 00:51:15,323
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

604
00:51:15,347 --> 00:51:17,363
Congratulations, sir.

605
00:51:17,387 --> 00:51:19,243
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

606
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:21,403
Get over here!

607
00:51:21,427 --> 00:51:23,003
Get your ass over here.

608
00:51:23,027 --> 00:51:25,683
Get in here, big boy.

609
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,747
You're beautiful!

610
00:51:29,707 --> 00:51:32,683
Yeah! Gimme five! Good choice!

611
00:51:32,707 --> 00:51:35,107
You fucking earned it, man.
You fucking earned it.

612
00:51:39,507 --> 00:51:41,323
Everybody, hello!

613
00:51:41,347 --> 00:51:43,387
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

614
00:51:47,387 --> 00:51:51,187
Can everyone be quiet for a moment?

615
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:54,907
Thank you.

616
00:51:56,267 --> 00:51:58,443
- Get rid of her.
- That would play awful.

617
00:51:58,467 --> 00:51:59,763
She's a fucking 1.1.

618
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:05,203
Now for those of you who don't
know me, which is... all of you...

619
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:09,243
my name is Lacie Pound

620
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:13,107
and, believe it or not,
I am one of Naomi's oldest friends.

621
00:52:13,707 --> 00:52:15,827
Hi, Nay-Nay!

622
00:52:17,107 --> 00:52:20,203
It's great to meet you too, Paul.
I've heard a lot about you.

623
00:52:20,227 --> 00:52:22,083
He's a pretty big deal, that Paul.

624
00:52:22,107 --> 00:52:24,563
Pretty big deal.

625
00:52:24,587 --> 00:52:28,283
He makes his own tapenade! Yeah.

626
00:52:28,307 --> 00:52:30,307
Uh...

627
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:34,787
Anyway, um... I...

628
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:40,923
have looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life.

629
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:42,883
We met when we were five years old,

630
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:47,067
and right up through to our teenage
years, we made quite the pair.

631
00:52:47,787 --> 00:52:50,083
We'd talk about all the
things girls talk about,

632
00:52:50,107 --> 00:52:56,443
you know, boys, hair, products,
uh... more boys.

633
00:52:56,467 --> 00:53:00,083
I mean, I tried sometimes
to expand our range a little

634
00:53:00,107 --> 00:53:04,787
and talk about climate change,
but she found that kind of boring so...

635
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:06,843
Go on.

636
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:09,763
She was probably right.
I mean, fuck the planet, right?

637
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,363
Whoo!

638
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:15,883
Yes, thank you! Come on.
Let's have a little fun here.

639
00:53:15,907 --> 00:53:18,483
You know, fuck the planet!

640
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:20,963
Fuck the planet!

641
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,747
Anyway...

642
00:53:26,827 --> 00:53:33,843
I... looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life,

643
00:53:33,867 --> 00:53:39,147
which meant she was looking down on me.

644
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:43,043
Always with a smile though.

645
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:47,683
In high school,
she was my shoulder to cry on.

646
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:53,043
She seemed to enjoy that.
Guys and me never worked out.

647
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:57,627
They'd see Naomi and just... Whoo!
You know, that was it.

648
00:53:58,507 --> 00:54:04,403
She had this tight ass,

649
00:54:04,427 --> 00:54:07,603
like two fists.

650
00:54:07,627 --> 00:54:09,363
Uh-huh.

651
00:54:09,387 --> 00:54:12,483
I was all like...

652
00:54:16,067 --> 00:54:18,603
I was like...

653
00:54:18,627 --> 00:54:20,467
through the hallways in high school.

654
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:40,587
And she was there for me.

655
00:54:43,027 --> 00:54:44,467
Holding my hair back...

656
00:54:46,107 --> 00:54:51,347
as I knelt, vomiting,
in front of the crapper.

657
00:54:55,947 --> 00:54:59,427
Thank you for that, Naomi.

658
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:04,347
I always wished I was you.

659
00:55:06,627 --> 00:55:07,907
And...

660
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:11,227
I guess that's why you
kept me around so long?

661
00:55:14,427 --> 00:55:17,443
Until you got your new job

662
00:55:17,467 --> 00:55:22,427
and your fancy new friends.

663
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,803
And that...

664
00:55:28,707 --> 00:55:31,827
...fucking... jackhole!

665
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:36,163
And you didn't need me.
You probably got another me.

666
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:41,603
Guess there's some other "yeth Beth"
you moved on to like a succubus.

667
00:55:41,627 --> 00:55:44,387
I'm getting to Mr. Rags, okay? Jesus!

668
00:55:45,227 --> 00:55:48,147
Stay back.

669
00:55:49,627 --> 00:55:52,683
Stay the fuck back! I'll kill him!

670
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:54,603
I'll cut his head off
and stick it up my ass!

671
00:55:56,947 --> 00:55:59,443
Time's nearly up!

672
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:00,643
- Hey! Calm down.
- I...

673
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:05,723
I just wanted to say, in this
world so caught up in our own shit,

674
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:09,147
- let's not forget what matters.
- It's okay. It's okay.

675
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:15,707
Happiness, fucking Paul
and Naomi, and she's...

676
00:56:16,187 --> 00:56:20,307
She... She fucked Greg!

677
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:23,827
I know she did.

678
00:56:24,907 --> 00:56:27,843
- I know you did.
- No...

679
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:30,203
Don't even try to deny...

680
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:38,043
The little girl who, when we
were just five-years-old in art camp,

681
00:56:38,067 --> 00:56:41,747
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared

682
00:56:42,427 --> 00:56:44,923
and helped me make Mr. Rags.

683
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:50,523
He reminds me of you and
what you meant to me then!

684
00:56:50,547 --> 00:56:54,107
And I'm so honoured
to be here to see this shit!

685
00:56:55,027 --> 00:57:00,227
I love you, Nay-Nay!
I've always loved you!

686
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:03,587
I love you!

687
00:59:48,787 --> 00:59:50,643
What the fuck are you looking at?

688
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,707
Just what I was wondering.

689
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:53,749
Well...

690
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:56,612
Don't!

691
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:00,643
Don't? Don't wonder?

692
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:01,827
Uh-huh.

693
01:00:02,427 --> 01:00:04,752
It would be a dull
world without wonder.

694
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:07,571
I don't give a shit about your world.

695
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:10,307
I don't like your brassiere.

696
01:00:13,707 --> 01:00:15,187
I don't like your moustache.

697
01:00:16,587 --> 01:00:18,443
I don't like your aura.

698
01:00:18,467 --> 01:00:20,707
- My aura?
- Yeah.

699
01:00:22,427 --> 01:00:26,283
I don't like your... head.

700
01:00:26,307 --> 01:00:29,043
Your entire head is
just ridiculous to me.

701
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:30,283
Really?

702
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:36,163
You look like an alcoholic
former weatherman.

703
01:00:36,187 --> 01:00:38,723
You sound like a lost little lamb

704
01:00:38,747 --> 01:00:41,227
that just got told there's no Santa Claus.

705
01:00:42,467 --> 01:00:45,243
What sort of cartoon character
did your mum have to fuck

706
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,923
to brew you up in the womb?

707
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:48,683
At least I look like I was born,

708
01:00:48,707 --> 01:00:53,243
not shit out by some tormented cow
creature in an underground lab.

709
01:00:53,267 --> 01:00:55,003
You got tossed out of that lab.

710
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:57,563
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, flushed out.

711
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,483
- Ooh!
- In the trash!

712
01:01:00,507 --> 01:01:04,123
- Your face is a fucking...
- Fucking.

713
01:01:04,147 --> 01:01:08,083
Fucking biological car crash

714
01:01:08,107 --> 01:01:10,163
that made Picasso screw
his eyes up and say,

715
01:01:10,187 --> 01:01:11,723
"Well, that just don't make sense."

716
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:16,203
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Fuck you!

717
01:01:16,227 --> 01:01:19,049
- Fuck you next Wednesday.
- Fuck you for Christmas!

718
01:01:19,074 --> 01:01:23,914
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

719
01:01:27,557 --> 01:01:33,636
