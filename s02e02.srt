00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:15,401
Hello?

3
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:18,142
Ah...

4
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,182
Hello?

5
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:28,742
Hello.

6
00:04:57,342 --> 00:04:58,822
Can you help me?

7
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:03,302
Do you know who I am? I... I...

8
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:08,182
I can't remember who I am.

9
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:28,141
Hello?

10
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:30,221
Do you know who I am?

11
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:31,661
Please!

12
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:33,302
I can't remember.

13
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:14,622
Lady, help me!

14
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,581
Help me!

15
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:18,782
Help me, please.

16
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,221
Oh! Help!

17
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:36,702
Help me. He's got a gun! Help me!

18
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,901
Hey! We have to go!

19
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:43,821
Come on!

20
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,222
Oh, my god! Help!

21
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:49,141
Oh, my god!

22
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,141
Stay back!

23
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,582
Back! Get back!

24
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,262
Get back. Back!

25
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:02,022
Let me in. Let me in!

26
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:03,982
Help me! Help me!

27
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:11,982
Shit!

28
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,182
There's a door round there.

29
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:20,261
It's locked.

30
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:21,260
You don't know that!

31
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:22,342
There's a keypad.

32
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:24,021
We should try it.

33
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,662
Get down! Anybody stands up,
they'll shoot their heads off.

34
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:30,141
He's trying to kill me!
What's going on?

35
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:32,100
Shut up! I'm trying to think!

36
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,462
He can see you. Get back.

37
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:39,421
Oh, my god!
What's wrong with those people?!

38
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,940
Why aren't they helping us?
They're just watching...

39
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,302
Where the fuck have you been?

40
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:44,581
What?

41
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:46,662
Get that extinguisher.

42
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,021
I can't! I can't do it!

43
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:51,621
Get it. Get it now!

44
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:54,181
OK... OK... OK...
OK... OK...

45
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,542
Come on.

46
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:58,782
Quickly. Slide it to me.

47
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:03,862
Damien, if he climbs through, you
grab him and you grab his gun.

48
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:04,861
I can't...

49
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:05,621
You can.

50
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:06,781
He'll shoot me!

51
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:08,141
You have to!

52
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:11,460
I'm going to smash the lock off that
door, you help him with gun guy.

53
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:14,420
He can't shoot all of us.
If he fires, he has to reload.

54
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,222
We either rush him or run, OK?

55
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:17,381
I can't do this!

56
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:19,341
We have no choice!

57
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:20,342
Help him.

58
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,381
Urgh!

59
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:24,741
Damien!

60
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:25,942
Oh, my...

61
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,702
Get him!

62
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:48,502
Urgh! Urgh! Urgh!

63
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:04,341
Get down.

64
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:05,582
Shh!

65
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,342
Fuck!

66
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:19,662
Shh!

67
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:49,662
No.

68
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:54,222
We have to go, come on.

69
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:57,382
Shit.

70
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:00,062
Stay down.

71
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:03,422
Shit.

72
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:06,862
Stay down.

73
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:15,980
Who are they?
Why do they look like that?

74
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,662
They like scaring people.

75
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:18,662
What?

76
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:23,421
OK. We have to run for that opening.

77
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,061
No, they'll see us.

78
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:27,342
If they're busy with him
we can lose the hunters, OK?

79
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:28,621
No.

80
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:29,982
You just stay with me. OK?

81
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:30,981
OK.

82
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:32,262
Ready... Come on...

83
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:38,648
Wait.

84
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,208
Wait!

85
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:54,543
The onlookers sometimes wait
in the windows, keeping lookout.

86
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:58,343
I'm pretty sure that's how they find
us. Through the cameras somehow.

87
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:01,303
Onlookers spot you and a few minutes
later the scary bastards turn up.

88
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:02,984
This is mad, this is just mad.

89
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:05,706
Hold it together and do
what I say or you'll get us killed.

90
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,945
I...

91
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:11,624
I woke up in this house and I don't
even know if it's my house.

92
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,426
I don't even know who I am.

93
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:15,105
You must know something.

94
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,665
Ah!

95
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,865
I think this is my daughter.

96
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:20,648
But you don't know?

97
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,729
She could be anywhere.

98
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:27,409
Maybe you tried to kill yourself.
Would that explain it?

99
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,688
There was pills.

100
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,968
I don't blame you.

101
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:32,487
Lots have tried that fun
fork in the road since it started.

102
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:33,649
Since what started?

103
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:36,768
You really don't know?

104
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,248
No.

105
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:41,007
There was a signal... Like pictures,
flashing pictures.

106
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:43,209
They just appeared on every TV,
every computer,

107
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,008
anything with a screen.

108
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,208
Argh!

109
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,528
Ugh!

110
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:51,369
I saw it. I saw it.

111
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:55,769
Get down.

112
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,528
They did something to people.

113
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,647
Like, almost everybody just became
onlookers,

114
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,527
started watching, filming stuff,

115
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:08,487
like spectators who don't give a
shit about what happens.

116
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,509
That's, like, nine
out of ten people now.

117
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:11,931
But not us.

118
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,970
Some of us weren't affected.
I don't know why.

119
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:16,330
Like that man with the gun
and that woman.

120
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:19,370
I call them "hunters". You might've
noticed that's what they do.

121
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,330
They seemed normal, but they
realised

122
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:22,930
they could do what they wanted

123
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:26,370
and they started taking stuff,
nicking cars cos they could,

124
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,490
doing what they like and not just
with things, with people.

125
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:32,810
It got worse and worse.
And now they've got an audience.

126
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:35,212
So this... This thing on the TV,
the...

127
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,411
The signal.

128
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:38,850
That's what's making them act like
this?

129
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:41,050
I guess they were always like that
underneath.

130
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,810
Just needed the rules to change,
for no-one to intervene.

131
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,212
What we going to do?
What we going to do?

132
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:48,291
Do? Do nothing. We get out.

133
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,211
Where's "out"?

134
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:52,930
We're here.
We need to head south of here.

135
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,292
They've knocked the transmitters
out, it's OK there.

136
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,731
The TV transmitters, they carry it.

137
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,010
There's only one between us

138
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,812
and the safe zone and we're going to
knock it out. See, it's here.

139
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:02,932
White Bear.

140
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:07,731
What?

141
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:08,892
White Bear...

142
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:16,171
Uh! Ungh!

143
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:20,852
A picnic with my
two best friends.

144
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:28,530
Jesus, what is it with you?

145
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:30,412
White Bear, you said White Bear...

146
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:31,612
So?!

147
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:36,612
Look, whatever's wrong with you,
you have to keep it together. OK?

148
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:39,411
Listen to me! Don't go out there.

149
00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:40,652
What's your problem?

150
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,091
Huh? You want something to look at?

151
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:46,092
Cos I'll give you something
to look at!

152
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,892
No, I want to talk to him.

153
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:51,331
I want to talk to you!

154
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,611
Ah!

155
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:54,892
It's not so funny now, is it?

156
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:00,332
Put it down.

157
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,132
I just want to see what
they're looking at.

158
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,891
I said put it down.

159
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:08,770
It's dangerous.
Their phones, they're dangerous.

160
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:11,412
It's the signal. The images are
on them, they're on the screen.

161
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:12,891
What?

162
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:14,891
Don't look at it!

163
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:15,892
Don't look at it.

164
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,892
'Jemima...'

165
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:32,890
No, no. This is all wrong.
This is all wrong!

166
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:34,412
They're coming. Run! Run!

167
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,451
Get in.

168
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,852
Get in. Come on.

169
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:51,852
Come on.

170
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:56,571
Come on, now! They're coming!
Quick.

171
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:58,852
Come on, hurry up. Get in.

172
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:12,410
You nearly killed us back there.

173
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,332
Yeah, well, I wasn't expecting you
to be there, was I?

174
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,731
I just saved your lives.
A wee 'thank you' would be nice.

175
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,011
I should've just run yous over.

176
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:23,451
Who are you?

177
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:25,531
Who are you?

178
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:27,772
It's not a hard question, is it?

179
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,531
I know... I know you.

180
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:37,052
Do you? Well, where did we meet,
if you know me?

181
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:42,570
No. Didn't think so, yeah.

182
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:43,892
She's not in a good way.

183
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,572
Yeah, I'll say.

184
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,532
So what are yous doing out here
anyway?

185
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,291
Heading south.

186
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,610
That's not a good move.
It's all blocked up down there.

187
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,050
There's a transmitter there...

188
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:56,610
I don't think you understand.

189
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:58,612
When I said, "It's not a good move",

190
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:02,531
that means I'm not driving
you down there.

191
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:04,731
I know a safe place we can go.

192
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:06,411
The woods.

193
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,370
Your safe place is in the woods.

194
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:09,492
How'd you know that?

195
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,531
I don't... I don't know.

196
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,332
Christ, maybe you do know me.

197
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:19,971
Yeah, we pull up and we get out.

198
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:21,852
We talk. There's no-one chasing us.

199
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:23,051
Mystic Meg.

200
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:24,332
And then what happens?

201
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:27,532
We eat.

202
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,371
Told you. No bars.

203
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:42,972
They'll never find us here.

204
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:48,411
That your daughter?

205
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:50,051
Yeah, I think so.

206
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,771
Where is she?

207
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:53,131
I don't know.

208
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:54,492
What'd you do to your wrists?

209
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:55,931
Don't know.

210
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,852
History of mental illness?

211
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:02,131
Yeah, I bet you do. Lay money on it.

212
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:03,771
What about you?

213
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,891
What about me?

214
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,772
Mental illness, weaknesses...

215
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:09,690
Everyone's got weaknesses.

216
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:12,490
Yeah, you two have got more
that most, I'd say.

217
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:16,412
That's why you're on the receiving
end, you see. Vulnerable.

218
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:18,531
Receiving end of what?

219
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:22,971
This. Everything that's going on.
Easy pickings.

220
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:24,931
What's your weaknesses then?

221
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,331
My weaknesses?

222
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:29,132
Show you if you want.
You want to see it?

223
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:32,932
Wait there don't move.
You're going to like this.

224
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:35,131
Not a lot.

225
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:36,930
This better not be naturism.

226
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,132
Yeah, in your dreams.

227
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,211
Tada!

228
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,132
Run and I'll shoot you in the back.

229
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,651
Right, come over here.

230
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:48,692
Stand there.

231
00:17:54,052 --> 00:17:56,491
You, here, put this on.

232
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,892
Put it on. Backwards,
so it covers your eyes.

233
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:11,170
Put your hands on her shoulders.
Keep them there.

234
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:13,052
You're her eyes now, all right?

235
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:16,771
And that is a shotgun, OK?

236
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:19,930
If I pull this trigger, it's going
to cut you, both in half.

237
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:21,732
So no funny business, all right?

238
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,211
Right, off you go.

239
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:26,452
Straight ahead.
Keep going through the trees.

240
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,731
Come on, pick up the pace.

241
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:34,610
Got a lovely
playground for you down there.

242
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:36,052
That's it, through here.

243
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,252
That's it, straight ahead.

244
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:47,412
Grab her!

245
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:52,772
Right, now take her balaclava off.

246
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:22,172
Get down there.

247
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:30,532
Oh, fuck.

248
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:33,852
Come on.

249
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:36,892
Head towards that ladder.

250
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,051
Get down there.

251
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:46,692
Right, stop. Get on your knees, both
of you. Give me that bag.

252
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,731
Fucking bag.

253
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:50,132
You, get down.

254
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:52,612
Stop whingeing.

255
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,012
Stop fucking crying.

256
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:58,131
Stop it. Eurgh!

257
00:19:58,688 --> 00:19:59,888
Yeah.

258
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,126
I'm down in that wood spot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy.

259
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,366
I'll just lash them to a tree or
something like that.

260
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:08,506
Just hurry up and get down here.
I want to get started.

261
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,562
It's going to piss... Fuck!

262
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:20,704
Your mate's fucked off. You're in
double trouble now, missus.

263
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:23,183
Get up on that log. Now! move!

264
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:26,104
Get your hands through there.
Get your hands through there!

265
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:27,823
Right through.

266
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:31,463
Push your arms up. Push them!

267
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,984
Get them up there!

268
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:39,823
Are we going to put a show on for
these guys today, eh?

269
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:41,472
Eh?

270
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:48,454
Let's see what Daddy's got in the
bag, shall we? Oh...

271
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:52,614
Oh! Oh, mama.

272
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:55,094
Help me! Help me!

273
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,414
Please, just help me!

274
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,574
Why are you doing this to me?

275
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:02,095
Whoa-ha! Oh yeah!

276
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:06,814
Help me, please. I'm a human being!

277
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:09,533
They're not going to help you.
They're going to watch.

278
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,213
What I'm going to do here darling,

279
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:13,575
is just going to push this
straight through your...

280
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:16,855
Help me!

281
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,634
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you!

282
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,411
For what?

283
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:44,251
For coming back for me.

284
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:45,532
I came back for this.

285
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:54,332
There's more like him on the way.

286
00:22:01,412 --> 00:22:02,652
Come on.

287
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,149
Whitebear's not far from here.

288
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,869
If we step on it we might be able
to shut it down before they get us.

289
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,815
- What happens if we can't shut it down?
- We can.

290
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:55,494
How? Do we hack into it,
or something?

291
00:22:55,561 --> 00:22:57,880
We don't hack anything.
We burn the control room down.

292
00:22:57,881 --> 00:23:00,722
It's not hard, we just slosh a load
of petrol round, strike a light

293
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:03,401
and fucks the electrics
or something.

294
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:05,001
Here.

295
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:06,322
In the bag.

296
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:09,922
It's the plans
for the transmitter compound.

297
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:14,482
I've been planning this, you know.

298
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:23,041
Jemima?

299
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,361
Lie down for me, darling. Go on.

300
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,121
It's a game.

301
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:29,242
Yeah, just like what Teddy does.

302
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:32,882
Lie down for me, darling.

303
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:37,842
Turn around!

304
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:38,881
What?

305
00:23:38,882 --> 00:23:41,960
White Bear, there's something not
right about White Bear. I remember!

306
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:45,202
You "remembered" the woods, too.
Sorry if I don't trust your hunches.

307
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,442
OK. Looks clear.

308
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:07,682
OK.

309
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,882
He was good for something,
after all.

310
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:46,321
Hurry up, we need to go!

311
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:49,242
Come on... Get out...

312
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,442
Come with me...

313
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:03,362
A picnic with my two best friends.

314
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:07,882
Come on.

315
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,122
This way.

316
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:19,920
Oh, shit. They'll be here
any minute. Give me the plan.

317
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:21,880
The transmitter tower's over there

318
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:24,642
and the cabling runs
underground into that building.

319
00:25:24,643 --> 00:25:26,242
Come on!

320
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:38,002
Thought so.

321
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:45,642
Let's go!

322
00:27:03,562 --> 00:27:05,682
Get back.

323
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:09,562
Or everything goes up.
I mean it... Stay back.

324
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:14,482
Stay back.

325
00:28:24,675 --> 00:28:27,035
Wh, wh, wha, what...?

326
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:32,835
Thank you.

327
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:39,794
So. I guess you're wondering
why you're here?

328
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:42,453
Well,
it's time to tell you who you are.

329
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:52,456
You've looked better.

330
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,305
Do you recognise him?

331
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:01,984
Uh... Yeah.

Or, should I say, was your fiance.

334
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:17,065
In case you haven't guessed,
the pair of you aren't very popular.

335
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:20,064
But I'll tell you what you are
though.

336

There were no tears

You filmed what he did.
A poor wee girl.

Helpless and terrified

Take as many photographs as you
want, take as many photographs

390
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:40,824
as you can, but most importantly,
what I need from you

391
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:44,705
is to shout and scream and let that
bitch know that youse are out here.

401

♪ Doo-ba-doo-ba-do... ♪

403

You've had a bad day,
but this will wipe it clean.

404
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:42,145
Get you in the mood to start again.

405
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:46,944
No! Please! Get off me!
What are you doing?

406
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,545
Takes about 30 minutes...

407
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:55,624
for it to fully
do the business.

408
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,705
So while it does...

409
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:02,745
Why don't we watch
some in-flight entertainment?

410
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,465
Please, no.

411

'Healthy stuff, like apples'.

412
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:12,264
Please stop.

413
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:14,984
You should enjoy this.

414
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:16,344
You shot it.

415
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:20,825
'Made it together,
so that my two friends...'

416
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:30,105
'Erm... A picnic for me
and my two best friends.'

417
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:00,665
Help me.

418
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:55,023
'OK everyone, we're about to head
into the park

419
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:56,625
so I'll hand you over to Baxter.'

420
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:05,144
Thank you.

421
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:08,103
All of our roles are very,
very important, yours included.

422
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:10,025
Now, yours come
with some basic rules.

423
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:12,784
Rule number one, no talking,

424
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:16,543
not just to her, but each other
as well, unless it's essential.

425
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,865
We're trying to get her to believe
that youse are all mesmerised.

426
00:38:20,905 --> 00:38:23,745
I know, I know, I know,
but she's believed it up to now.

427
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:29,024
Morning, ticket please.
Thank you.

428
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:32,264
'OK, rule number two,
keep your distance.'

429
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:34,943
I can't stress the importance
of this one enough, OK?

430
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:37,425
Don't forget,
she's a dangerous individual.

431
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:40,584
Imagine that she's an escaped lion.

432
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,383
Now yesterday, she threw
a projectile, and we will step in

433
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:46,263
if she gets too close.
We're all equipped with tasers,

434
00:38:46,264 --> 00:38:48,943
but then we're into story shutdown
and we've all wasted a day.

435
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:51,545
So it's best to keep your distance
at least three metres back.

436
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:53,545
You can use your camera zoom.

437
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,504
'Last, but not least,
enjoy yourself'.

438
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,303
That's probably the most
important rule of all, OK?

439
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:04,463
Take photographs, run around through
the woods, but try and stay safe.

440
00:39:04,464 --> 00:39:06,905
We'll be keeping an eye on you,
making sure you're all OK.

441
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:08,144
So get out there,

442
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,785
enjoy yourselves and let's make
this show happen, people! Come on!

443
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:25,985
Ow!

444
00:39:46,665 --> 00:39:48,025
Look, there she is.

445
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:56,425
'Don't know yet.
I'm kind of knackered.'

446
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:58,424
Me, too.

447
00:39:58,425 --> 00:40:01,345
'She's just leaving her house now.
Two minutes tops.'

448
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:04,025
Right, you are. We're on.

449
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:32,625
Watch out!

450
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:37,943
He's trying to fucking kill me.
What's going on?

451
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:39,425
'Get that extinguisher.'

452
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:43,185
It's OK, they've gone.

453
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,545
Convincing, eh?

454
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,625
We got two minutes.

455
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:05,745
Help!

456
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:12,305
Help me!

457
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,064
'Early screamer.'

458
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:32,145
It's an early screamer tonight.
So keep the noise up and let's go!

459
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:52,441
Ow!
